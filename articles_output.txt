You can still make decent money even if you are not a financial ninja. Of course, you will have to go through some basics, but your job will be much more easier if you decide to design your financial strategy based on certain alerts or, in other words, if you want to rely on forex news trading. </p><p>In essence, it is a concept where a person ( trader ) can plan his investment strategy based on daily news and reports. This is crucial for forex trading in general. As you know, in this financial construction, your job is to predict movements on the currency market and to try to earn by making smart moves. In fact, your success and potential profit depends on the difference or currencies. And currencies and their values depend on various factors on the global market. It can be almost everything - from political crises over natural disaster to speculative activity of big corporations.</p><p>Stay tuned with forex news</p><p>Currencies are very “sensitive” and they react on even the smallest changes. Because of all that, you have to be able to predict such changes and try to earn as much as possible. It is, without any doubt, highly risky and uncertain business, which is the reason why many people believe you have to be an expert in almost every field if you want to be successful. In some way, those people are right, because your job is to understand and monitor all movements on the world’s market. This is, of course, far beyond every person’s capacity. Even the biggest investing companies cannot cover all aspects, which is the reason why they are forced to invest in particular financial fields.</p><p>However, there is a solution for this serious problem. You can be very successful in this type of online trading if you decide to design your strategy according to forex news. As you just saw, planning and predicting are crucial ingredients in this business. Fortunately, you don't have to monitor all news and you can choose between several subcategories and improve your chances for better investing. You can focus your attention on news about currencies, long-term trends and expectations or short- term alerts that can bring you immediate profit. </p><p>But there is one catch. Planning your strategy based only on forex news is not as easy as it might look. It isn't an automated process, where you can rely only on such alerts. Things are more complicated than that. The global currency market is one of the most uncertain. Even the “hottest” news can be wrong and turn you in the wrong direction. If these news were 100% accurate, then we would all be millionaires. </p><p>On the other hand, using this strategy is definitely something that will save your time and keep you away from a number of troubles and potential risks. </p></div>", datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

(14, 'News Trading in Forex', 'https://www.earnforex.com:443/forex-course/news-trading/', '<div><article> <div>\n<p>The word “news” refers to an unfolding event that traders may not notice at first, although some news will move markets instantly, even when the news was expected. News about central bank decisions and related matters (such as comments on the sidelines of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Seven_(G7)">G7 meeting</a>) will move markets immediately, while others are more subtle and take time to sink in. An example is then-new Greek Prime Minister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Papandreou">George Papandreou</a> announcing in late 2009 that Greece had been underreporting its budget deficit. Eventually this led to a peripheral sovereign debt crisis, but nobody saw the extent of it at the time.</p>\n<p>So we have “expected news” and “unexpected news,” and both types of news can inspire trader action that is either short-term or long-term. As a rule, expected news moves markets less than unexpected news, but analyzing price behavior can become tricky and complex.</p>\n<p>A key question is how long the effect of news will last. Trading lore says: “Buy on the rumor, sell on the news.” This is as true in Forex as in equity trading. In equities, the price of a stock will go up on analyst forecasts of good earnings, but fall after the earnings announcement even when the earnings surpass expectations. The same thing happens in Forex. A currency will be bought ahead of a central bank rate hike decision that is universally expected, but fall on the announcement even when the rate is indeed hiked, exactly as expected. This seems counter-intuitive but reflects that traders who positioned correctly ahead of time are now taking profit.</p>\n<p>Therefore, you need to know your holding period with absolute conviction ahead of big news events. If you are a buyer of a currency ahead of an expected rate hike and in fact, the central bank delivers a hike, you need to endure the following drop in the currency and have a stop-loss order that accommodates the drop.</p>\n<h2>Central Bank Decisions and Speeches</h2>\n<p>Headlines of central bank decisions, especially when they are unexpected, have an immediate effect on the market. Traders might be caught off guard by the magnitude of the hike or cut or by the decision to raise or lower rates. Sometimes key rates are left unchanged but the accompanying statement is tweaked subtly to hint at a dovish or hawkish bias. The announcement of non-standard measures, such a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing">quantitative easing</a> (QE), also has the power to move markets. In this case, a decision that goes the way the market expects would be deemed “expected news.” Such a decision might not see as much volatility as a decision that surprised, which would be deemed “unexpected news.”</p>\n<p>Central banker speeches can roil currencies if the speaker diverges from commonly-held thinking. A good example is the long-standing principle held by the German <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Federal_Bank">Bundesbank</a> that QE would be completely unacceptable for the eurozone. When Bundesbank chief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Weidmann">Weidmann</a> said QE might be on the table, it was unexpected news and the euro fell, even though the consensus of trader opinion is that the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/">ECB</a> will not engage in QE. Nobody accused Weidmann of jawboning (see below), but his comments had the same effect as jawboning. The Weidmann comment injected a new degree of uncertainty into the overall perception of the risk surrounding the euro.</p>\n<p>After QE was adopted as an <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omt/html/pspp.en.html">official ECB policy</a>, the Bundesbank returned to its old stance of opposing it on principle, so comments by Bundesbank chief Weidmann stopped being “news.” However, in the October of 2016, some unnamed sources told the press that the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Keep it simple by finding a pair you are interested in, and learning as much about them and their volatility in relation to news and forecasting. Make sure that you understand their volatility, news and forecasting.</p><p>\nNever trade on your emotions. Emotions, such as panic, fear, anger, revenge, greed, euphoria, apathy and desperation, can have detrimental effects on your <i>Forex trading</i>. While your emotions will inevitably affect your decisions in a small way, don\'t allow them to become a primary motivator. This will end up wrecking your trading strategy and costing you money.</p><p>\nAvoid using emotions with trading calculations in forex.

The key is to concentrate on news releases that have an immediate impact on the market. There are about 5 to 10 important news from U.S and about 3~5 each from UK, EURO Zone, Australia, Canada, and Newzeland. These news releases are usually scheduled monthly or quarterly; they\xa0will repeat every month around the same day of the week or day of the month.</p><p>We only trade news releases that are currently considered as “hot”, meaning that\xa0the market is particularly interested in it. For example, a few years ago during the\xa0real estate boom, U.S. Housing Start, Existing Home Sales, and New Home Sales\xa0were constantly ignored and no one was paying attention to it. Why? Because at\xa0the time economy was doing good, home sales were always better than expected,\xa0and market just assumed the best and basically ignored the numbers. Look at the\xa0same news releases today in mid 2008,</p><p>Housing news releases were particularly\xa0important because the economy is suffering, any signs of rebound from the\xa0housing sector signals improvement in the economy, as many market analysts\xa0pointed out; therefore, housing data is currently “hot”. Similarly, the weekly\xa0Jobless Claims just became “hot” recently because of former Fed. Chairman\xa0Greenspan talked about it in his book…Other news releases such as consumer confidence, current account, and even the\xa0TIC Net Long‐Term Securities are currently being ignored. But they will eventually\xa0become hot again, as many of these news releases and market focus work in\xa0cycles, just as the fashion industry.</p><p>The key to trading economic news successfully is to be selective with news\xa0releases to trade. As stated before, with hundreds of news released monthly,\xa0why risk with less important news releases and gamble your hard earned money\xa0when you can trade with news that have a higher probability of success?</p><p>Therefore, I have compiled a list of news releases that have a high probability of\xa0success (at least 70%) backed by solid track record.\xa0Another important “hot” factor in today’s market is RISK. There are basically two\xa0different reactions to Risk, one being “Risk Aversion” and the other “Risk\xa0Appetite”.</p><p>Risk Aversion basically means to avoid risk. Market will react go with the safest\xa0route, selling high yielding currencies and buying low yielding currencies, such as\xa0BUYING CHF and JPY while SELLING GBP and AUD. Few instances recently of<br />\nextreme market risk aversion, GBP/JPY pair have been documented losing up to\xa01000 pips in a 24 hour period.\xa0This is an extreme example but not an isolated case, we have seen risk aversion\xa0taking over market sentiment and dropping USD/CHF, GBP/JPY, AUD/JPY 200 to\xa0500 pips a day.</p><p>What kind of news sparks Risk Aversion? The answer: Any news that creates risk\xa0(or rumor of risk) in the market, for example:</p><p><em>1. Geopolitical uncertainty – Rumors of war or actual terrorist attack.</em><br />\n<em> 2.\xa0Sub-prime\xa0Mortgage Write‐down – Bear\xa0Sterns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,\xa0etc…</em><br />\n<em> 3.

It said that the Federal Reserve was “likely to consider” raising interest rates by 0.75 percentage points at its meeting on June 15th. The article was unusually silent about its sources. And it proved uncannily prescient. Two days later the Fed did indeed raise interest rates by that amount, its biggest increase in 28 years. Many investors believe the central bank had used the press to warn financial markets about what it would do in advance (albeit not very far in advance). That would make the <i>Journal</i> story an unconventional example of “forward guidance”.</p><div><figure><div><figcaption>Listen to this story.</figcaption> <p>Enjoy more audio and podcasts on <a href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a> or <a href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>.</p></div><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></figure></div><p>Central banks often telegraph what they might do before they do it. This kind of forward guidance is as old as central banking itself, according to Willem Buiter, a former rate-setter at the Bank of England. It is certainly as old as inflation targeting. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (which was the first to adopt a formal inflation target in 1990) quickly learned that it could move markets with its utterances (what it called “open-mouth operations”). It now publicly forecasts its own decisions. If you want to know where it thinks its policy interest rate will be in the future, you do not have to look out for mysteriously sourced stories in the press. You can just download the central bank’s spreadsheet.</p><p>This kind of guidance is intended as no more than a prediction, based on the central bank’s fallible forecasts of the economy. It is sometimes called “Delphic” guidance, after the oracle of Delphi in ancient Greece. If the economy defies the forecast, as it usually does, the central bank may well defy its prophecy of its own behaviour. In a paper published in 2012, Jeffrey Campbell, then of the Chicago Fed, and his co-authors distinguished Delphic forward guidance from another kind, “Odyssean”. Odyssean guidance is more than just a prediction. It includes a promise or commitment of some kind. Central bankers use it to tie their own hands, like Odysseus lashing himself to the mast of his ship. </p><p>Why would they do that? The aim, as the paper put it, is to change public expectations about what central banks will do tomorrow, so as to improve the economy today. In a slump, a central bank might not have room to cut short-term interest rates by enough to revive the economy. (Rates cannot easily be cut below zero.) It might then promise to keep rates low for longer than it otherwise would, even after hearing the siren call of an economic recovery. If its promise is believed, expectations of inflation will rise. That will magically reduce the real cost of borrowing even when the central bank’s policy rate can fall no further. </p><p>Odyssean language crept into central-bank guidance after the financial crisis of 2007-09. In April 2009, for example, the Bank of Canada promised, with some qualifications, not to raise interest rates for 14 months. In 2016 the Bank of Japan said it would keep easing until inflation had durably overshot its 2% target. Similar commitments were made in the pandemic. When a central bank is stuck close to the zero lower bound, it can at least say what it will do—or refrain from doing—when economic conditions warrant it moving again. Its words speak louder than inaction.</p><p>But when a central bank is not so constrained, the case for Odyssean forward guidance becomes less clear. If a central bank is free to act, why rely on words rather than deeds? In particular, why bother with forward guidance during a tightening cycle? There is, after all, no upper bound on interest', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Surely, officials are bluffing, right? But think about it from the central banker’s perspective. Yes, a recession would be bad: people would lose their jobs, and it could take a while to recover. But recessions happen all the time and they rarely ruin any central banker’s reputation. Some, such as Paul Volcker, are even celebrated for their “toughness” in the face of economic pain. And if a recession happens now, the authorities can blame Putin or say it was the only way to tame the inflation monster (they love a good counterfactual). Runaway inflation, on the other hand, would leave a darker legacy. Jerome Powell, Christine Lagarde and others would be joining Arthur Burns on university syllabuses for the semester on “historical monetary failures”. In 40 years’ time, economists would still be discussing how they “let IT (the 1970s) happen again”. No central banker wants to become a case-study in how to fail.</p>\n<p>When I tweeted about the distorted personal incentives central bankers face, someone replied: "Is this what monetary policy has become? A silly [legacy-] covering exercise?” (he used different, less polite wording). Partly yes. Officials feel utterly embarrassed about their “transitory” call in 2021, and you should never ignore the human element in policymaking. But the new bias goes deeper than that. It is also important to remember that the reason we have independent central banks is to ensure that the 1970s cannot happen again. So, we are talking about a risk that undermines the central bankers’ entire raison d\'être, an existential threat. In fact, “price stability" is a prerequisite for everything else they do. It is the foundation of monetary policy. When investors ask about the pain central banks are prepared to tolerate, they are thinking about the wrong trade-off. The authorities are prepared to suffer a recession now because they fear a much worse recession in the future if price stability is lost. The trade-off, as officials see it, is intertemporal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A\xa0<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2022e2.htm">recent report from the BIS outlines the nightmare scenario for central banks</a>. For a long time, BIS analysis has not been useful for analysing monetary policy. The Basel-based “central bankers’ central bank” was obsessed with publishing endless critiques of ZIRP, QE and other “unconventional stimulus”, a message that clearly did not resonate with the view at the top of the Fed, the ECB or the majority of officials who were actively involved in policy decisions. But the BIS’s latest report on the danger of a “new paradigm” in global inflation clearly strikes at central bankers’ worst fears. It explains, clearly and with lots of fabulous charts, why the authorities are suddenly more hawkish than anyone could have imagined 12 months ago – why Jerome Powell is suddenly celebrating Paul Volckers’ legacy, and why the ECB and even the BoE now have a rather bizarre obsession with the monetary traditions and “credibility” of the Bundesbank.</p>\n<p>The BIS analysis is largely statistical. It argues that there are two basic inflation regimes – “low” and “high”, each of which has its own self-reinforcing properties, although economies occasionally transition from one to the other. In the low-inflation regime, “relative” or sector-specific price changes are the dominant driver of the CPI. These tend to have a transitory effect, as they die out quickly. This is not a regime in which wage- or price-setters need to pay a great deal of attention to the overall inflation rate. Aggregate price pressures are subdued, and everyone takes this for granted. In the “high-inflation regime”, on the other hand, broader CPI developments start to have a much more discernible impact, with inflation itself becoming the focal point for private-sector decisions. This shift in emphasis leads, in turn, to behavioural changes that will cause inflation to become entrenched. In the high-inflation regime,', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

The predictions are so consistent that even the general public thinks it knows where the trends are leading us: Asia and Latin America up, Europe and North America in a holding pattern, Africa and the Middle East down. But maybe the predictions are wrong.</p><p> Goldman Sachs started the game almost a decade ago with its study predicting that the BRICs, the four largest emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India and China), would overtake the rich countries of the G7 (the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada) some time in the 2030s. The world’s economic centre of gravity, the study implied, was shifting from the West to Asia.</p><p> Hardly anybody disputes this model any more; the pundits just differ on the details, like when China’s economy will pass that of the United States. As soon as 2020, said PricewaterhouseCooper. 2027, says the latest Goldman Sachs prediction. 2035, says the Carnegie Institute. As late as the mid-2040s, according to Karen Ward’s recent study for HSBC. But they all agree it’s going to happen.</p><p> Ward’s study, “The World in 2050,” is particularly interesting for two reasons. One, because it is more realistic about China, whose economy is currently the biggest bubble in world history. And two, because it offers predictions for the world’s 30 biggest economies, not just the top ten.</p><p> China’s economy, at $25 trillion annually, is only a couple of trillion ahead of the United States in 2050. (All calculations are in constant dollars of the year 2000.) Then there is a long drop to India at $8 trillion and Japan at $6 trillion – and no other country reaches $5 trillion.</p><p> Places five to eleven are mostly filled by the rest of the G7 countries, with only Brazil and Mexico breaking into the magic circle. The rest of the Top Twenty, however, are almost all developing countries (Turkey, South Korea, Russia, Indonesia, Argentina, Egypt and Malaysia), with only Spain and Australia from the developed world. So in this model, Asia and Latin America really are taking over, with eleven out of the top twenty slots.</p><p> Now, you can quibble with bits of this, like categorising Russia as an emerging economy. In terms of infrastructure, average education level and birth rate, Russia is clearly a developed country. But if these predictions are roughly correct, then it is definitely Asia and Latin America up, and Europe and North America (plus Japan) in a holding pattern.<br /> And are Africa and the Middle East really down? Up and down are purely relative, of course, and there are certainly some large African countries with quite respectable projected growth rates, like Nigeria and South Africa. But despite the world’s highest population growth rates, no African country’s economy makes it into the Top Twenty by 2050.</p><p> Of the Middle Eastern countries only Egypt scrapes in at No. 19, just ahead of Malaysia (which has only a third of Egypt’s population). Most of the non-oil economies face virtual stagnation, and there are big question marks over the claimed oil reserves of a number of the oil states. Africa and the Middle East down.</p><p> It’s only a game: only the very brave or the very foolish would base major investment decisions on such a long-term extrapolation of current trends. But it’s the sort of thing that the strategists and the geopolitics experts love – and it could be wrong. Not just wrong in detail, but utterly, spectacularly wrong.</p><p> All of these predictions assume that global conditions will remain essentially unchanged for the next forty years. That is highly unlikely.</p><p> The predictions are not simple-minded straight-line extrapolations. They all assume, for example, that China’s economy, which has grown at ten percent for the past twenty years (and therefore doubled in size every seven years), will drop to about half that growth rate (doubling only every fourteen years) well before 2050. But they do assume that energy – especially oil – will remain plentiful and relatively affordable for the next forty years.</p><p> Even more implausibly,', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

But this does not mean there have not been big movers in the technology space. Tech stocks have both lost and gained. Over the past year, the S&amp;P 500 North American Technology Sector Index has risen about six percent. But what are the best emerging tech stocks? Which companies are the best tech startups?</p>\n<h2><b><i>Emerging Tech Stocks to Buy in 2017</i></b></h2>\n<p>We shall limit the analysis to five of the best emerging tech stocks; especially, technology stocks for long-term investors. Some of your favorites might be missing, and if they are not included here, it does not mean they aren’t worthy of consideration. Now, the term “emerging technology stocks” implies companies at the startup stage, or thereabouts. Yet to limit the analysis to “emerging tech” under that narrow definition would go against the point of this article, which is to suggest some profit opportunities, which just happen to be tech-related.</p>\n<h3><b>1. NVIDIA Corporation</b></h3>\n<p><b>NVIDIA Corporation </b>(NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of my favorites. It’s been a sleeper, but investors have taken notice; it’s definitely one of the stocks to own for the next technology boom. NVIDIA stock has almost doubled in growth, thanks to an ever-increasing market share in graphics processing units and personal computer (PC) graphics cards, which are so important to gaming. NVIDIA’s not alone; it has to contend with rival <b>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.</b> (NASDAQ:AMD)—itself an interesting emerging tech stock—but NVIDIA is winning the market war now. Investors and analysts were pleased by NVIDIA’s revenue growth and its expansion into new and promising markets.</p>\n<p>NVIDIA earned record revenues of $1.43 billion in its second quarter of 2016, an increase of 24% year over year. About 55% of this revenue is derived from the gaming segment, but the company is growing income in other segments too. And this is what makes it such a candidate for the next technology boom.

But grow it did, and now FB stock is one of the most solid stocks in the tech sector, rising above expectations every time. But Facebook has more than just “a lot” of users. One of its big projects for 2017 involves the emerging technology of VR.</p>\n<p>Facebook has taken a major presence in VR technology with its “Oculus” VR, a technology startup it bought for $2.0 billion. This alone could be one of the main drivers for Facebook stock in 2017. Facebook wants to adapt the concept of VR to that of the social media platform. New teams at Facebook Inc are already developing what could be its next generation of products: VR social apps.

(Charles Platiau/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></div><p>As you shop for Thanksgiving dinner this year, you may long for the good old days when food was cheaper. This isn’t just your nostalgia speaking. Over the past decade, food prices have increased at a very fast clip. According to the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization, the global food price index has increased by 125 percent since 2000. To understand why, consider the seemingly intractable prices of global commodities markets—your standard agricultural goods like coffee, sugar, and wheat, or resources like crude oil and coal that are used to produce or transport those goods. Not only do these complex commodities markets determine the cost of what we eat, but their high prices can fuel the kind of social unrest that in some countries has toppled governments.</p><p>These markets are as volatile and hard to forecast as the effects of their swings are contradictory. Commodities are both the origin of major fortunes as well as the reason behind financial crashes. Their gyrations also drive major shifts in geopolitical power—they can boost the influence of some countries while weakening others. For example, during the commodities boom that took place between 2000 and 2010, exporters of soy, iron, cotton, oil, copper, wheat, petroleum, wood, and other basic goods did exceedingly well. Countries from Brazil to Malaysia used the windfall to improve living standards for millions of their poorest citizens. According to the World Bank, the size of the Latin American middle class grew by 50 percent—from 103 million in 2003 to 152 million in 2009. Since then, despite the global recession, the region’s middle class has continued to grow—to the point where, the World Bank reckons, its members are currently more numerous than the poor for the first time in history.</p><p>In these ways, high global commodities prices have been a boon to emerging markets and a source of global economic stability. Economic growth in China and India—whose populations account for 37 percent of the world’s population—has done much to fuel the rise in demand for commodities. In the past five years, agricultural imports to China alone have grown by 23 percent each year. But the spike in demand has also added to the uncertainty that characterizes these markets. The planet is paying dearly too, as rapid growth in consumption—especially of goods like oil, coal, and metals that are non-renewable and highly polluting—has contributed to the dangerously high carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere.</p><p>Now, however, there is a widespread perception that commodity markets are about to hit a wall that, once again, will trigger important shifts in the world economy and international politics. Many experts believe that the current installment of the “commodity supercycle” is winding down. These supercycles are periods of high prices that last for about 15 years on average and that have regularly appeared over the last 150 years. In the past decade, for example, the average price of commodities doubled. This sharp rise contrasts with the fact that, over the course of the 20th century, commodity prices (adjusted for inflation) fell an average of 0.5 percent every year.</p><p>To complicate matters, between 2000 and 2013, the price of commodities not only soared, but their variations were three times more extreme than they were in the 1990s. Consistent with this high volatility, prices have now stopped rising—a trend reversal that started two years ago. In the first half of 2013, the <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPROSPECTS/Resources/334934-1304428586133/CommodityMarketsOutlook_July2013.pdf">world index of commodities prices</a> fell 10.5 percent, and the prices of some metals—copper, aluminum, and nickel—fell a whopping 20 percent. The economic slowdown in China, the anemic situation in Europe, and sluggish growth in the United States have all contributed to a drop in demand and a halt in price increases.</p><p>The surprise is that despite the many forces pushing commodities down, prices on average remain roughly at the same level as they were in 2008, when the global economic crisis began.

This is the first of three articles about commodity price, covering basic material that someone buying or selling commodities should understand. The need for the information goes well beyond the trading desk of a broker, however. Plenty of sales people and purchasing managers should understand commodity pricing, even if commodities are only a small part of the day’s work. Further, anyone whose company is heavily dependent on some commodity should understand that commodity very well. The product may use copper or cotton, leather or lead. In any case, understanding how commodity prices change will help you buy or sell whatever your company is involved in.</p>\n<p><b>Commodity Basic Fact #1: Commodity prices are more variable than overall prices.</b></p>\n<p>The chart below compares changes in the CRB commodity price index with changes in the U.S. Consumer Price Index. The CPI sure looks stable when plotted against commodities. The next article will help explain why commodity prices sometimes shoot up, why they stay up for a while, and why they then come crashing down. It’s a dramatic story, so you may want a check with your doctor before reading it.</p>\n<p>The CRB index is a composite of a number of different commodity prices. As such, it is more stable than any one of its components. So the more specialized indices, such as for metals, is even more volatile. And then any particular metal will have even more volatile prices that the index. So for any basic material, expect far more price variation than in the overall economy.</p>\n<p><b>Commodity Basic Fact #2: Commodity prices rise less than overall prices, on average.</b></p>\n<p>Since 1950, the average annual increase in the CRB index has been 2.5 percent, compared to 3.7 percent for consumer prices. That’s a huge difference when you consider compounding. Over 63 years, the CPI has risen to ten times its starting value; the CRB to just five time its starting value. This is despite a rising population and rising global standard of living that has us consuming more stuff.</p>\n<p>It turns out that of all the things that humans do, processing commodities is something we’ve gotten much better at. We pump oil more efficiently, we mine ores more efficiently, we grow grains more efficiently. We’re not much better at cutting hair or pouring a glass of beer or doing many of the things that are part of the service economy. But we’re pretty good—and getting better—at producing commodities.</p>\n<p>We’re also better at finding substitutes. When whales were over-caught, whale oil became more expensive. We developed petroleum. Plenty of plastic objects were at one time made of steel. Saw mills can now cut veneer much thinner than ever before, meaning that it doesn’t take much wood to dress up an otherwise ugly sheet of plywood.</p>\n<p>This lies behind the famous bet between Paul Ehrlich and Julian Simon. Ehrlich, author of <i>The Population Bomb</i>, believed (and maybe still does) that rising population would cause shortages of critical commodities. Simon, an economist, saw productivity increasing faster than demand. He bet Ehrlich that five commodities (selected by Ehrlich) would fall in price. Ehrlich thought they would rise in price. Ehrlich lost and paid up.</p>\n<p>Now let’s go really far back. In the era from 1800 to 1810, wheat ranged in price from $1.00 to $1.84 per bushel. Most recently it sold for $6 to $8. Note that since 1800, the Consumer Price Index is up by a factor of 14. So wheat has not come anywhere close to keeping up with the CPI.</p>\n<p>Copper sold for $9.50 at its low, $11.65 at its high in the early 1800s. Now it trades at $3. It not only didn’t keep up with inflation, it didn’t even stay level in nominal terms.</p>\n<p>Steel nails sold for about $10 per 50-pound bag.

The advent of <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/how-to-invest-in-commodities-with-commodity-etfs-1214756">commodity ETFs</a> has made this process much easier. There are also other investments like managed futures that can make money regardless of which direction the price of commodities move. If you are investing in commodities using a percentage of your investment portfolio, timing isn’t necessarily as important as it is for trading commodities.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe two most common times when investors flock to commodities is during times when commodities become very cheap, and commodities are considered a value play. The other time is when commodities are hitting multi-year highs and investors want to <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/trend-following-in-commodities-trading-809367">catch the trend</a>. In reality, most <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/what-are-hybrid-funds-2466758">asset classes</a> attract the most investment dollars after they experience a period of high returns. Sometimes this is a good philosophy, but often investors buy at the top of the market.\n</p>\n<p>\nCommodities, in essence, are a hedge against inflation. Over a period of decades, commodities typically keep pace or exceed the rate of inflation. Therefore, a buy and hold strategy makes sense, regardless of when an investor buys commodities.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen trading commodities, many strategies can be utilized to take advantage of price trends. One of the more common strategies is scale trading when the price of a commodity reaches multi-year lows. Once a commodity falls below the cost of production, the theory is that the price probably won’t fall much lower and a major bottom is near.\n</p>\n<p>\nCommodity traders don’t necessarily need commodity prices to move higher to make money. Trading with <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/understanding-a-futures-contract-809394">futures contracts</a> allows commodity traders to get in and out of the markets easily, as well as making money from commodities moving lower. Commodity traders typically use a particular trading strategy and take advantage of short-term movements in commodity prices.\n</p>\n<h2> Best Time to Buy Commodities </h2>\n<p>\nThere is no set formula for the best time to buy commodities, just like stocks. It really depends on an investor’s time horizon and investment goals.

Despite the euphoria around shale gas – indeed, despite weak global growth – commodity prices have risen by as much as 150 percent in the aftermath of the financial crisis. In the medium term, this trend will continue to pose an inflation risk and undermine living standards worldwide.</p>\n<p>For starters, there is the convergence argument. As China grows, its increasing size, wealth and urbanisation will continue to stoke demand for energy, grains, minerals and other resources.</p>\n<p>For example, the US consumes more than nine times as much oil as China on a <em>per capita</em> basis. As more of China’s population converges to Western standards of consumption, demand for commodities – and thus their prices – will remain on an upward trajectory.</p>\n<p>Of course, not all commodities are equal. For example, although the case for copper seems straightforward, given that it is a key input for wiring, electronics and indoor plumbing, a strong bid for iron is not as obvious, given the Chinese infrastructure boom that already has occurred in the last two decades.</p>\n<p>Worst-case estimates have China’s real GDP growing at around 7 percent per year over the next decade. Meanwhile, the supply of most commodities is forecast to grow by no more than 2 percent annually in real terms. All else being equal, unless China’s commodity intensity, defined as the amount of a commodity consumed to generate a unit of output, falls dramatically, its demand for commodities will be greater this year than it was last year.</p>\n<p>As long as China’s commodity demand grows at a higher rate than global supply, prices will rise. And the rapid economic growth that China’s leaders must sustain in order to lift enormous numbers of people out of poverty – and thus prevent a crisis of legitimacy – places a floor under global food, energy and mineral prices.</p>\n<p>To be sure, intensity of use has fallen for some commodities, like gold and nuclear energy; but for others, such as aluminum and coal, it has <em>risen</em> since 2000 or, as is the case for copper and oil, declines have slowed markedly or stalled at high levels. As the composition of China’s economy continues to shift from investment to consumption, demand for commodity-intensive consumer durables – cars, mobile phones, indoor plumbing, computers and televisions – will rise.</p>\n<p>There is also the issue of the so-called reserve price (the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a good or service). The reserve price places a cap on how high commodity prices will go, as it is the price at which demand destruction occurs (consumers are no longer willing or able to purchase the good or service).\xa0</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Signs point to tougher times for China economy</strong></p>\n</div>\n<p>For many commodities, such as oil, the reserve price is higher in emerging countries than in developed economies. One explanation for the difference is accelerating wage growth across developing regions, which is raising commodity demand, whereas stagnating wages in developed markets are causing the reserve price to decline. By implication, if nothing else, global energy, food and mineral prices will continue to be buoyed by seemingly insatiable emerging-market demand, which commands much higher reserve prices.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, emerging economies’ absolute size and rate of growth both matter in charting commodity demand and the future trajectory of global commodity prices, with <em>per capita</em> income clearly linked to consumers’ wealth. If people feel rich and enjoy growing wages and appreciating assets, they are less inclined to cannibalise other spending when commodity consumption becomes more expensive. They just pay more and carry on.</p>\n<p>Of course, upward pressure on commodity prices also stems from supply-side challenges. It is not just that global supplies of resources are increasingly scarce, but also that supplies are increasingly falling into inefficient hands.</p>\n<p>Around the world, governments are taking greater control of resources and imposing policies that hamper global production and ultimately force prices higher (following the recent fracas surrounding Argentina’s nationalisation of Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF), Australia’s 2012 mining tax on iron and coal companies is a stark reminder that such tendencies are not limited to emerging-market politicians).</p>\n<p>', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Take a pinch of salt with the <em>explode</em> part of the headline because there are no known techniques for consistently forecasting the character of a forthcoming price move. I am not ruling it out, merely forecasting that in one way or another prices are likely to be substantially higher by year-end.</p>\n <div>\n <p>Commodity indexes are a disparate bunch, and some have already experienced tentative breakouts while others look set to. What\'s really interesting is that traders in other markets, which often anticipate commodity rallies, have already started to discount inflationary times ahead. If effect, they are telling commodities that it\'s time to get moving.</p>\n \n <p>Chart 1 for instance, features the stock market in the form of a ratio between the Goldman Sachs Natural Resource ETF and the Spider Consumer Staples, the IGE \n <a href="/investing/fund/IGE?mod=MW_story_quote">IGE,\n -0.73%</a>\n \xa0 versus the XLP \n <a href="/investing/fund/XLP?mod=MW_story_quote">XLP,\n -0.39%</a>\n \xa0. </p> <p>When it\'s rising, this stock market relationship is forecasting commodity inflation. That\'s because traders are more enthusiastic about bidding up the price of the inflation-sensitive IGE than its defensive and deflationary counterpart the XLP. You can see from the chart how the ratio\'s movements correspond quite closely to those for the Dow Jones UBS Commodity ETN \n <a href="/investing/fund/DJP?mod=MW_story_quote">DJP,\n -2.48%</a>.\n </p> <p>What is clear though, is that the ratio violated a 2-year down trendline last Thursday. That suggests it\'s going higher. In effect, it\'s the stock market\'s way of forecasting higher commodity inflation. Moreover, this price action also signals a change in sector leadership in favor of earnings-driven areas such as energy mines and basic industry over deflationary beneficiaries such as homebuilders, financials and utilities. The bottom window features, the Special K, a summed cyclical rate-of-change indicator. It is designed to identify primary trend reversals, and does so on a fairly consistent and accurate basis when it crosses trendlines of nine months or greater duration. As you can see, it broke above its bear market trendline last week and strongly supports the breakout of the DJP above its 2013 down trendline.</p> <p>The other asset class to signal a more inflationary environment is bonds. For instance, the recent rise in yields and drop in prices has been widely attributed to liquidation ahead of the Federal Reserve unwinding its bond purchase program. </p> <p>However, that could be a smoke screen for the fact that bonds have actually been anticipating a bout of commodity price inflation. Remember, they hate inflation as it eats into the purchasing power of credit market instruments. That point is debatable, but what is not, is recent price action of a powerful bond relationship that is closely tied in to commodity price movements.</p>\n \n <p>You might think that studying the price action of inflation protected bonds would be a guide to inflationary expectations and a safe haven for capital when yields rise. However, the Barclays Tips Bond ETF \n <a href="/investing/fund/TIP?mod=MW_story_quote">TIP,\n -0.93%</a>\n \xa0, has lost around 10% of its value since April, so that\'s not the answer.

(30, 'The Outlook for Commodities in 2021', 'https://internationalbanker.com/brokerage/the-outlook-for-commodities-in-2021/', '<div><div>\n\t<p><em>By </em><strong>Hilary Schmidt</strong><em>, International Banker</em></p>\n<div><p>This article was originally published in the Winter/February 2021 edition of International Banker</p></div>\n<p>For most commodity markets, 2020 was undeniably a turbulent year. The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic triggered a widespread global shutdown of economic activity that depressed demand and disrupted supply chains for commodities in virtually all sectors—energy, base metals, agricultural products and even the odd precious metal—and culminated in a nadir for the asset class; the Bloomberg Commodity Index, which tracks 23 commodity futures markets, hit an all-time low in April, and the price of crude oil took a nosedive into negative territory for the first time ever. By April, West Texas Intermediate crude futures contract trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) had reached around -$37 per barrel (/bbl). But in many cases, the latter half of the year saw the prices of several important commodities rally spectacularly and, in a few cases, reach multi-year highs.</p>\n<p>Will the commodities sector be able to push on from this rebound in 2021 and achieve further gains? Already this year, several markets have witnessed considerable bullish sentiment, prompting many analysts to project a brighter future for commodities as the world strives to put the impact of COVID-19 behind it once and for all. Of particular interest with this rally has been the weakness of the US dollar, which is the <em>de facto</em> currency used to price virtually every global commodities market. A weak dollar means commodities are cheaper for global buyers when converted back into their domestic currencies and, as such, will induce greater demand, all else being equal. “The only way to get commodities moving in an inflationary, buying power way is a weaker dollar,” Doug King, head of RCMA Capital’s Merchant Commodity Fund (MCF), recently told MarketWatch.</p>\n<p>As such, much will likely depend on whether the dollar remains weak throughout the year. But of course, there are a number of demand and supply factors that influence each commodity across the complex in its own way. Nonetheless, many expect commodities as a whole to perform well in 2021. ING, for instance, sees a global economic recovery, expansionary monetary policy and fiscal stimulus being provided by several governments as being particularly supportive. Such factors have boosted inflation expectations, the bank noted, which should induce further inflows into this asset class.</p>\n<p>As far as oil is concerned, Brent Crude prices surged by 8 percent in January, and by early February, they had reached their highest levels in over a year, thus entirely negating the pronounced losses that transpired from the outbreak of the pandemic onward. What’s more, the rally in crude looks far from over, with the underlying fundamentals supporting more gains this year. According to S&amp;P Global Platts Analytics in its late-January oil-market monthly forecast, oil demand will average 99.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2021, which is more than six million more than 2020’s 93.1 million bpd. That said, following a spike in COVID-19 cases in late 2020/early 2021, this latest forecast is down from its previous estimate by 0.28 million bpd.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, more upside is expected for oil prices this year, especially after OPEC’s (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) top producer, Saudi Arabia, recently decided it will cut one million bpd of crude output in February and March. “Oil balances tighten heading into Q3 with a seasonal summer demand boost, higher refinery runs, and an improving outlook for the COVID situation amidst ongoing vaccinations,” Platts Analytics stated. As such, most analysts are predicting prices to head higher. Goldman Sachs sees Brent crude oil hitting $65/bbl halfway into the year, while UBS has raised its forecast to $60/bbl for the same time period. “Oil has also seen some speculative interest, but there is clearly room for more buying in the energy space over 2021,” ING noted in December.</p>\n<p>For base metals, however, the picture seems decidedly more mixed. This sector of the commodities complex was the best performer overall throughout much of 2020, particularly the latter half of the year as China’s economy recovered more quickly than expected and as a weak US dollar and supply challenges also provided support to prices.

Maurice Obstfeld, a former chief economist at the <small>IMF</small>, recently argued that central banks’ failure to consider the global effects of their policies puts the world economy at risk of a “historic” slowdown. While any given rate rise may be justifiable, together they could have a greater effect than anticipated.</p><div><figure><div><p></p></div></figure><p>Rising inflation is a consequence of too much money chasing after a constrained supply of goods and services. Rate-raising central banks set out to slow growth by dampening spending, but in a globalised economy spending flows across borders. When one central bank tries to quash demand it affects consumption of foreign goods as well—in effect helping other central banks to manage their inflation problems. If such spillovers are not taken into account, the global economy will slow by more than central banks had individually aimed to achieve.</p><p>Financial flows work in parallel with this process. A rate rise in one country may attract money from investors elsewhere, causing the currency to strengthen. This means a reduction in import costs, which may help to cool domestic inflation. But other economies then face higher import bills, which exacerbates their inflation problems. Unco-ordinated policy tightening can become its own sort of currency war, in which each country works to shift the burden of inflation elsewhere, with the net result being too much tightening.</p><p>The world’s biggest co-ordination problem, however, may be less one of every-central-bank-for-itself and more one in which a single dominant central bank—America’s Federal Reserve—calls a tune which others must follow, like it or not. The dollar’s outsized sway in the global financial system grants it a powerful role in driving global financial cycles. A recent paper from Mr Obstfeld and Haonan Zhou of Princeton University notes that monetary tightening in America is strongly associated with an appreciating dollar and a deterioration in a number of global economic and financial measures. </p><p>The Fed’s commitment to returning American inflation to 2% leaves it little room to accommodate other economies. It may welcome rate rises elsewhere as a helpful contribution to America’s inflation fight, even if countries begin falling like dominoes into recession. Indeed, the more spare capacity is created in other economies, and the greater the downward pressure that places on prices globally, the less unemployment may need to rise in America in order to achieve the Fed’s aims. </p></div><p>The world has become much more financially integrated since 1971, when John Connally, then Treasury secretary, said to representatives of the world’s other large economies that “the dollar is our currency, but it’s your problem”. As interest rates across the world spiral upward in an unco-ordinated manner, the probability that any economy emerges from this experience unscathed sinks ever lower. ■', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

In today’s more volatile markets, the clocks can be brutal. The yen has fallen by 20% against the dollar this year, the South Korean won by 17% and India’s rupee by 9%. After Kwasi Kwarteng, Britain’s chancellor, unveiled fresh tax cuts on September 23rd, the restless pound fell close to parity with the dollar. It was as wrenching as an alarm in the middle of a dream. </p><p>In the face of such discomfort, policymakers are often tempted to intervene in the currency markets. Japan’s finance ministry has tried to prop up the yen for the first time since 1998, selling foreign currencies in exchange for its own. The Reserve Bank of India has also acted, selling more than $40bn since the beginning of July by some estimates. South Korea’s finance minister has said the authorities will review “contingency plans” to stop the won falling so fast. Some economists have begun to look up how much Britain has stashed away in its foreign-exchange reserves. (Not a lot.) </p><p>Friedman thought currency defences were either unnecessary or impossible. If the shortfall in demand was large and lasting, intervention would only delay the inevitable, since the country would run out of foreign-exchange reserves. If the shortfall was small and fleeting, intervention was unnecessary. Instead of buying a temporarily cheapened currency, the government could rely on speculators to do the job, since they would profit whenever the currency regained its footing. Intervention was necessary only if the government was better at spotting a temporary misalignment than financial speculators whose livelihoods depended on it. </p><p>Early studies of intervention reinforced this scepticism. In 1982 the <small>G</small>7 commissioned a report which concluded that currency intervention had little durable effect. There was unusual consensus among economists that currency intervention was not an “effective or lasting” instrument, as Kathryn Dominguez of the University of Michigan and Jeffrey Frankel of Harvard later pointed out.</p><p>But more recent work has overturned this consensus, thanks both to theoretical and empirical advances. The longer-term impact of intervention can be hard to discern because central banks do not step into the currency markets at random. They sell foreign reserves when the currency is weakening and buy when it is under pressure to strengthen. And so a naive look at the data might suggest that intervention backfires: reserve sales are associated with a weaker currency, just as firefighters are associated with fires. </p><p>One response is to look at currency interventions that are bigger or smaller than would be expected. If a blaze attracts more firefighters than it would normally warrant, the extra firefighters will probably be associated with a shorter, better contained conflagration.

The history of coinage back to Roman times faced the problems of occasional debasement, whether by deliberate government actions, clipping, or wear and tear. As <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bimetallism-Economic-Historical-Analysis-Macroeconomic/dp/0521570913">Angela Redish</a> (2000) argued, it took the invention of milling and the steam press in the nineteenth century to overcome the last problem.</p>\n<p>The next innovation in money was the issue of fiduciary money (notes convertible into specie) in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to overcome the resource costs of precious metals (Adam Smith, 1776). Commercial banks originated in Italy with the issuing of warehouse receipts for deposited gold by goldsmiths in medieval Italy. This led to the evolution of fractional reserve banking. The social saving of fiduciary money had to be balanced by the credit risk of not adequately maintaining convertibility into specie, i.e., of violating “no questions asked.”</p>\n<p>Early proto-central banks, for example, the Bank of Amsterdam founded in 1609, were municipal or public private enterprises.

Just this year, Comcast (ticker: <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/money/lookup/stocks/CMCSA/">CMCSA</a>) is buying Time Warner Cable (<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/money/lookup/stocks/TWC/">TWC</a>) for $45 billion; Reynolds American (<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/money/lookup/stocks/RAI/">RAI</a>) is inhaling Lorillard (<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/money/lookup/stocks/LO/">LO</a>) for $27 billion; and Medtronic (<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/money/lookup/stocks/MDT/">MDT</a>) is moving to Ireland for a wee bit o\' tax avoidin\' with a $43 billion purchase of Covidien (<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/money/lookup/stocks/COV/">COV</a>).</p><p>What\'s driving corporate matrimony? Non-financial companies in the Standard and Poor\'s 500 have a near-record $1.2 trillion in cash sitting on their balance sheets, which, thanks to low interest rates and mild inflation, is melting like an ice sculpture at a Cancun beach wedding. Financing an acquisition is cheap these days, and some CEOs may be wondering just how long these days of cheap financing will continue.</p><p>But confidence in the economy and the markets may be the key. "Conditions for an increase in M&amp;A activity have been in place for a while," says Chis Lee, manager of Fidelity Select Financial Services Portfolio (<a href="http://fidsx/">FIDSX</a>). "Part of the constraint was around confidence at the CEO or the board level. Now, the risk of doing nothing seems greater than the risk of doing something."</p><p>Now that companies feel more confident, they\'re making the decision that it\'s cheaper to buy a rival than to build out their own expansion. In other cases, companies may get a lighter tax treatment by merging with a foreign competitor — although they also run the risk of facing the wrath of Congress and the public, as Walgreens (<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/money/lookup/stocks/WAG/">WAG</a>) discovered recently.</p><p>Mergers are not always good things: Many times, companies just aren\'t good matches. America Online and Time Warner, for example, tied the knot in 2000 for $164 billion, then divorced in 2009, when Time Warner sent AOL packing.</p><p>But mergers can be very good for the shareholders of the companies that are purchased, in large part because the buyer nearly always overpays. Typically, when a merger is announced, shares of the target company rise, while shares of the purchasing company fall. (One sign of the strength of the M&amp;A market recently has been that shares of both companies have tended to rise on the announcement, which is fairly unusual.)</p><p>One classic way to profit from mergers is called merger arbitrage. When two companies announce a merger, you buy shares of the company that\'s being acquired. At the same time, you sell short the shares of the company that\'s doing the buying.

I suspect this is true for most startup founders: buying a company seems prohibitively expensive and complex, and there is very little playbook for how to do a deal. Only after LiveRamp became a public company did I really begin to understand the toolkit: we had the balance sheet and the ambitions where we made several successful deals.</p><p>When I went back into the early-stage world, I brought this toolkit with me — and have now led 15 transactions (3 on the sell-side, and 12 on the buy-side) ranging from 6-figure to 10-figure deals. I credit the toolkit with accelerating Datavant’s path by several years, and helping us very quickly establish product-market fit and build scale.</p><p>I’ve tried to summarize the lessons that I’ve learned on the buy-side below, and will walk through:</p><ul><li>Why most M&amp;A fails</li><li>The four types of deals</li><li>Five prerequisites to considering M&amp;A as a strategy</li><li>The playbook: Executing the deal process</li><li>The playbook: Defaulting to no and debating the deal internally</li><li>The playbook: Structuring the deal</li><li>The playbook: Pre-planning the integration</li></ul><h2><strong>Why Most M&amp;A Fails</strong></h2><p>While I believe that well-executed M&amp;A can be a very valuable part of a toolkit, it’s important to recognize that most acquisitions made by most companies are poor decisions.</p><p>M&amp;A hypotheses are usually presented as a “1+1=5” scenario; you put together two companies, have some “synergies,” and suddenly the combined business is worth more than either business standalone.</p><p>In the vast majority of cases, this is overoptimistic. It’s helpful to think about this equation:</p><p><em>Value of Combined Business = Value of Acquirer + Value of Acquiree + Synergies — Dis-synergies</em></p><p>There are two very common mistakes that buyers make:</p><ol><li><strong>Over-optimism on synergies.</strong> It’s easy to imagine how everything can go right in a deal, without thinking through how hard it is to execute. The best way to solve this is usually to i) have a base case and a stretch case plan (and make sure the deal makes sense in the base case, and is a home run in the stretch case) and ii) make sure that executives on your team sign up for the numbers. It’s shocking how frequently deals happen with revenue targets that the head of sales doesn’t sign off on, for example.</li><li><strong>Not acknowledging the dis-synergies.</strong> Every deal has dis-synergies; these are usually: distracting the teams (both the deal process &amp; the integration are major distractions for both companies), culture mismatch or culture dilution, reducing the acquiree’s incentives and/or sense of mission, and increased organizational &amp; technical complexity. Under the right circumstances and well managed, these dis-synergies might create an “Integration Tax” of 10–20% — slowing down the business by that amount. But it can also be 100% if not well managed.</li></ol><p>As a result, instead of “1+1=5”, many deals end up “1+1 = 1.5” (or even “1+1=0.8”).

Many such bosses may get a call every week or so from an investment banker eager to offer the kind of deal that is sure to boost profits.</p><p>Plenty of those calls are proving fruitful. In the first three quarters of 2017, just over $2.5trn-worth of transactions were agreed globally, according to Dealogic, a data provider. The total was virtually unchanged from the same period in 2016, but the number in Europe, the Middle East and Africa was up by 21%.</p><p>It is easy to understand why an executive opts for a deal. Buying another business looks like decisive action, and is a lot easier than coming up with a new, best-selling product. Furthermore, being the acquirer is far more appealing than being the prey; better to be the butcher than the cattle. A takeover may keep activist hedge funds off the management’s back for a while longer. And being in charge of a much bigger company is a more demanding task that will surely justify (ahem) a larger salary for the executives in charge.</p><p>But these temptations, good and bad, should generally be resisted. S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence Quantamental Research, a research arm of the ratings agency, has updated a study on the impact of deals on the acquiring company’s share price. The study looked at M&amp;A deals done by listed companies in America’s Russell 3000 index between January 2001 and August 2017; deals were only included if they cost more than 5% of the total enterprise value of the acquirer (5% of the equity value, for financial companies). The acquirers’ shares underperformed the market (see chart) and those of rival firms in the same industry.</p><div><figure><div><p></p></div></figure><p>That share-price performance was understandable, in the light of what tended to happen to the fundamentals of the acquiring company’s business. The study finds that, relative to the company’s peer group, net profit margins fall, as do the returns on capital and on equity; earnings per share grow less quickly; and both debt and interest expenses increase.</p><p>As the deal is done, however, the executives always sound bullish. Costs will be cut, the companies will benefit from selling a wide range of products and so on; a whole range of “synergies” will be achieved. Instead, the combined companies tend to suffer from clashes of culture and teething problems as systems prove hard to integrate. The AOL-Time Warner merger of 2000 is perhaps the most famous example of a dysfunctional deal; at the time, it was one of the biggest mergers in corporate history. Not every deal is that bad. But instead of two plus two equalling the promised five, all too often they add up to three-and-a-half.</p><p>Investors should look for a few useful warning signs ahead of a takeover. The faster the company was growing before the acquisition, the worse it tends to perform afterwards. Large deals perform less well than small ones. All-share deals tend to perform less well than cash offers. Yet, despite this, companies with a lot of cash on their balance-sheets tend to be bad at making acquisitions, perhaps because the money is too tempting for executives not to use. Like a Wall Street trader with his first bonus, they are tempted to spend the money on something flash.</p><p>Of course, not all deals underperform. So it is understandable that executives will tend to imagine themselves in that blessed minority that manages to make their acquisition a success. After all, without a degree of self-confidence, they would not have become chief executives in the first place. Fund managers who believe they can defy the odds and pick stocks that beat the market may also believe that they can distinguish the value-adding takeover deals from the rest.</p></div><p>The tough questions ought to be asked of, and by, the non-executive directors on acquiring-company boards. They should realise that executives like to build empires, and to be seen to be “doing something”; they should be the resident sceptics. Why should they believe this executive’s latest idea for a deal will be an exception to the rule?</p><p>Perhaps fewer deals will take place in any case.

The last time things were this busy, they say, was in 2007-08.</p><p>Shareholders have some call to fear the worst. There is a weighty body of literature, some of it dating from the stockmarket bust of the early 2000s, that says mergers do not create value for the acquiring company.

Bankers had a full pipeline of deals. Then the pandemic took hold. A dealmaking <small>CEO</small> had to think again. If you had a merger in the works, you pulled it. You couldn’t project numbers with confidence. You didn’t know if you could afford a deal, or finance it. Even then, the calls with bankers never stopped.

A lot of this is down to market conditions, which quickly turned favourable and have remained so. Equity prices have roared back from their lows of late March. The companies with shares that rallied first—technology and health care—found themselves with a highly valued currency with which to pay for deals. The corporate-bond market has reopened with a vengeance, making debt finance available. Interest rates are at rock bottom and likely to stay there for a while. Private-equity firms have a lot of unused capital (“dry powder”) to call upon.</p><p>But financial conditions are not the only explanation. The economy is another.

The novelty and constant development of technology created an entirely new market. Work on crypto technology doesn\'t stop for a minute.\xa0<a href="https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2020-9417165c6444?ref=hackernoon.com">According to this report</a>, there are more than <strong>8,000 active developers</strong> working on various cryptocurrency projects every month, with 80% of those developers having started in the last two years. Thanks to this constant work, we can define the rise of a specific technology on the crypto market each year.</p>\n<h2>2016</h2>\n<p>The standout event of the year was the <strong>DAO</strong> hack. The DAO was a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) launched in 2016 on the Ethereum blockchain. After raising $150 million worth of ether (ETH) through a token sale, The DAO was hacked due to its codebase vulnerabilities. The Ethereum blockchain was eventually hard forked (in other words, a critical update has been implemented) to restore the stolen funds. Still, not all people agreed with this controversial decision, resulting in the network splitting into two distinct blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.</p>\n<h2>2017</h2>\n<p>This year was marked by the explosive popularity of Initial Coins Offerings (ICOs), a new way of fundraising with blockchain. The first <strong>ICO</strong> was Mastercoin and took place on the Bitcoin network back in 2013. But the popularity of this crowdfunding method reached its peak in 2017 with the development of Ethereum smart contracts.</p>\n<p>ICOs ultimately launched a new generation of blockchain projects that significantly shaped Ethereum and widened the whole crypto ecosystem. However, more than 2,000 unique token sales raised more than $10 billion cumulatively in 2017 and 2018. Also, the leading ICOs like FileCoin and Tezos raised more than $257M and $232M, respectively.</p>\n<h2>2018</h2>\n<p>The dominant trend in 2018 was the creation of <strong>stablecoins</strong>. Several companies released their stablecoins—alternatives to USDT. As a result, TUSD, USDC, and others appeared on the market. Besides, this was the same year the popularity of Dai algorithmic stablecoin (based on the whole system of smart contracts) began to grow. Subsequently, the BUSD stablecoin from the Binance exchange joined this trend.</p>\n<h2>2019</h2>\n<p>The ICO fever in 2017 proved to be a very high-risk tool for investors. So, <strong>IEOs</strong> were first introduced in early 2019 and have become a really popular way to launch new crypto projects. As with ICOs, IEOs involve the distribution of new crypto tokens to either a set of investors or the broader public. However, in an IEO, the organization trying to raise funds has to partner with a cryptocurrency exchange, which facilitates the actual token sale and distribution.</p>\n<h2>2020</h2>\n<p>This year was definitely the year of the Decentralized Finance (<strong>DeFi</strong>) popularity surge. Projects like Compound, yearn.finance, and Sushi were the primary catalysts of this surge. The whole crypto community was notably interested in decentralized governance, lending, and yield farming—the three key features of these new projects. Due to their success, we saw a rise in popularity of this cryptocurrency sector, both in the ever-increasing Total Value Locked—the key metrics for this sector—and in the numbers of new projects and blockchains enabling DeFi computing.</p>\n<h2>2021</h2>\n<p><strong>NFTs</strong> were first created back in 2015. However, they didn\'t gain popularity until early 2021. This was largely due to the rise in prices, trading volumes, and popularity of Cryptopunks and the OpenSea, as well as NBA Topshot marketplaces. Most interestingly, the popularity peak of early 2021 renewed again in the fall, primarily due to the use of NFTs in the GameFi project.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Also published in\xa0<a href="https://jjo.media/articles/top-crypto-trends-from-2016-to-20', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

While making intelligent predictions about the future may not be definite, the temptation is too great. Numerous seismic occurrences from 2022 will undoubtedly have an impact on the following year, and a few new trends are also expected to have a significant impact on what is already expected to be another crucial year for the cryptocurrency industry.</p>\n<p>Here are some possible responses to a few queries that will probably have a significant impact on the sector in 2023.</p>\n<h2>When will winter be over?</h2>\n<p>After months of unrelenting beating, the cryptocurrency market appeared to be on the verge of recovery by late October. This was because the stock market was beginning to stabilize, inflation was slowing, and forecasts for 2023 were cautiously hopeful.</p>\n<p>Then, one of the most well-known institutions in crypto burst into flames in real time.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://insidebitcoins.com/news/ftxs-stunning-collapse-what-really-happened">shocking failure of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX</a> last month shattered the market, causing Bitcoin to hit its lowest point in two years. Due to a combination of widespread panic in the market and an attacker who allegedly drained FTX wallets as the company was collapsing, the price of <a href="https://insidebitcoins.com/buy-cryptocurrency/buy-ethereum">Ethereum</a> fell to roughly $1,100 in late November.</p>\n<p>Although cryptocurrency prices have subsequently slightly increased, the ripple effect caused by FTX’s demise still persists. After blocking all withdrawals for many weeks, the digital asset lender BlockFi, which received a $250 million line of credit from FTX over the summer, filed for bankruptcy late last month.</p>\n<p>The company was one of the cryptocurrency businesses that were adversely affected by the demise of FTX. Sino Global, a blockchain-focused venture firm, confirmed “mid-seven figure” exposure to FTX; cryptocurrency investment and trading group CoinShares confirmed a $30.3 million exposure; cryptocurrency prime broker Genesis suffered a staggering $175 million exposure to FTX, and its lending arm suspended client withdrawals. Cryptocurrency exchange Liquid Global, acquired by FTX earlier this year, frozen all fiat and cryptocurrency withdrawals just days after its parent company collapsed.</p>\n<p>It’s almost probable that as 2023 progresses, more businesses will be required to declare potentially harmful connections to the once-dominant FTX, which appeared to have stretched its tendrils throughout the entire crypto industry.</p>\n<p>It’s unlikely that a crypto spring will be able to take root until the full impact of FTX’s $32 billion collapse is accounted for and its numerous links are revealed and processed. We would be shocked if the figurative line forms before the start of the actual spring given how unlikely it is that the crypto pandemic will abate anytime soon.</p>\n<h2>Is crypto legislation finally coming?</h2>\n<p>Despite the clamor and controversy surrounding cryptocurrencies that have come out of Washington this year, the<a href="https://insidebitcoins.com/news/elizabeth-warren-introduces-a-bicameral-bill-to-combat-crypto-money-laundering-clashes-with-oleary"> American government</a> has yet to provide any convincing answers regarding how to regulate crypto assets, protocols, and exchanges.

Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, meaning they exist independently of central banks or governments. They are protected by blockchain technology, making them difficult to game.

This growth is largely driven by an increase in institutional investment in cryptocurrencies, as well as an increase in public interest and awareness about cryptocurrencies. In addition, several large companies such as Tesla announced investments in bitcoin.</p><h2>Forecasts for 2023</h2>\n<div><p></p></div>\n<p>Analysts predict that the cryptocurrency market will continue to grow in the next few years.

This may be driven by further growth in institutional investment and wider adoption of cryptocurrencies among both businesses and consumers.</p><p>In addition, there are predictions that new technologies and applications will emerge in the next few years that could revolutionize the use of cryptocurrencies. These include staking protocols that allow users to earn rewards for holding a certain amount of coins; decentralized finance (defi) protocols that allow users to access financial services without relying on trusted intermediaries; non-playable tokens (NFTs), which are unique digital assets; smart contracts that facilitate automated transactions between two parties; and privacy coin technologies that allow users to better control their personal data when making transactions on blockchain networks.</p><p>Blockchain technology development is also expected to accelerate during this time period, with more focus on scaling solutions such as sharding protocols, layer 2 solutions such as plasma networks, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof?ref=hackernoon.com">zero-knowledge proof</a> systems such as zk-snarks being implemented to existing blockchain networks such as Ethereum.

There are a number of different trends that can be expected to happen throughout the remainder of 2021, so let’s take a look at each one and highlight just why each factor can be considered to have an impact in the near future.</p>\n<h3>Decentralised Finance</h3>\n<p>Most people will already know about the decentralised element that Bitcoin and crypto have, which is why it is no surprise that this factor will be something that continues to grow in the future. There have already been strong performances within this financial sector, and with experts predicting that adoption of digital storage of these assets will be accelerated, there is no doubt that DeFi will increase.</p>\n<h3>More Stablecoins</h3>\n<p>Stablecoins have continued to grow in numbers over the last few years, and with many of them offering a number of huge advantages that has seen them grow into coins that are trending already, more and more investors are already investing in them as a means to protect themselves from the market volatility being suffered by more traditional cryptos.</p>\n<h3>Bitcoin Gambling</h3>\n<p>Indeed, online gambling is one reason why crypto has managed to receive a huge boost in use and ownership in recent years with bettors able to use Bitcoin because of the advantages that the digital token will provide them and, as such, why it has to be considered one of the trends that will likely continue to happen throughout the remainder of 2021.</p>\n<p>When using them at the best live dealer crypto casino available, holders will be able to benefit by receiving the highest levels of security and safety, whilst also taking advantage of positives including faster transactions and low fees.</p>\n<h3>Tax Regulations</h3>\n<p>As the crypto market continues to boom and expand to countries that are starting to adopt them as a legal tender or a way in which some financial transaction can take place, it would not be a surprise if tax regulations were to be brought in. Of course, it is a currently unclear area, but it would not be a shock if countries decided to benefit from holders who use it within their jurisdiction, even if it will be an unpopular move considering the decentralised aspects of crypto.</p>\n<h3>Crypto Tax</h3>\n<p>Adding on to the tax regulations mentioned above, another trend that we may see before the end of 2021 could be to see an introduction of the crypto tax. A number of countries are already believed to be making plans to implement it into law, whilst there are governments said to be creating tools to monitor any cryptocurrency transactions that are taking place.</p>\n<h3>Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)</h3>\n<p>The Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is one of the most anticipated features that are yet to be implemented. Should it ever be permitted, it will allow for funds to be traded on the stock exchange. There is no reason why this trend would not boom in 2021 if it were permitted, as more traders would likely invest in cryptocurrencies, thus making the overall market benefit hugely.</p>\n<h3>Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs)</h3>\n<p>NFTs have taken the industry by storm over the last 12 months, with these digital assets being able to represent physical products in real life, as well as in digital form. These are useful for those who wish to be able to trade items as they can enjoy a rather simple process.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, NFTs are already highly popular, with these being used in the art and gaming industries already, however it should only be a matter of time before they are adopted in other industries.</p>\n<h3>Interest from Millennials</h3>\n<p>It is not just investors who have become infatuated with the crypto world, as millennials have taken a huge interest', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Companies in all industries have grown at lightning speed, in part because of an aggressive merger and acquisition strategy. The impact of technology and the Internet has only further increased the pace and size of deals. Buyers of all shapes and sizes have many of the same strategic objectives—to build long-term shareholder value and take advantage of the synergies that the combined firms will create—but each industry has its own specific objectives.</p>\n<p>Technology companies, in search of new ideas, new products, trained knowledge workers, strategic relationships and additional market share, have been the most acquisitive. Deals in the pharmaceutical industry are driven by the need to put more products into development pipelines and achieve certain economies of scale in combining research and development efforts. Defense industry mergers have been driven by shrinking federal budgets and the need to win private-sector. Deregulation in the energy and financial services industries have just begun to spawn deals driven by the ability to offer a more diversified range of services.</p>\n<p>Merger-and-acquisition frenzy has created intense competition for the same target companies, where a premium is placed on price and speed. The fear in many boardrooms is that the company will be left out or left behind if it doesn’t move quickly to acquire other businesses. Deals that used to take months to get done now close in a matter of days, especially if no regulatory approvals need to be obtained and no shareholder battles will take place as a condition for getting the deal completed. In this environment, acquisitions are moving so fast and are being bid up so high that the likelihood of problems and errors has increased dramatically.</p>\n<p>You need to be armed with as much knowledge and as many tools as possible to be an effective entrepreneur in this marketplace. This article, first in a series, offers some insights into the process of combining companies the right way.</p>\n<h3>Merger or Acquisition?</h3>\n<p>The terms “merger” and “acquisition” are often confused and used interchangeably by business and financial executives. On the face of it, the difference may not really matter since the net result is often the same: Two companies (or more) that had separate ownership are now operating under the same roof, usually to obtain some strategic or financial objective. However, the strategic, financial, tax and even cultural impact of the deal may be very different, depending on how the transaction is structured. <i>Merger</i> refers to two companies joining (usually through the exchange of shares) to become one. <i>Acquisition</i> occurs when one company, the buyer, purchases the assets or shares of another company, the seller, paying in cash, stock or other assets of value to the seller.</p>\n<p>In a stock-purchase transaction, the seller’s shares are not necessarily combined with those of the buyer’s existing company. They may be kept separate as a new subsidiary or operating division. In an asset-purchase transaction, the assets to be conveyed by the seller to the buyer become additional assets of the buyer’s company, with the hope and expectation that the value of the assets purchased will, over time, exceed the price paid, enhancing shareholder value as a result of the transaction’s strategic or financial benefits.</p>\n<h3>Reasons for Merger-mania</h3>\n<p>There is no single explanation for the current resurgence of merger and acquisition activity, and the full impact on the economy is complex and remains to be seen, but certain themes and trends have emerged. The key reasons deals are getting done are:</p>\n<ul><li>\n <i>Strategy.</i> Mergers and acquisitions are clearly more strategically motivated now than were their counterparts of the 1980s and early 1990s.

A thousand deals were struck by Jack Welch, its notoriously gung-ho boss, who ran the American industrial and financial giant between 1981 and 2001. The pace did not slacken under his successor, Jeffrey Immelt. The result has been a monumental destruction of shareholder wealth. The firm’s market value peaked at $594bn in 2000. Today it is a relatively measly $83bn.</p><div><figure><div><figcaption>Listen to this story.</figcaption> <p>Enjoy more audio and podcasts on <a href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a> or <a href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>.</p></div><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p><div><p>Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask</p></div></figure></div><div><figure><div><p></p></div></figure><p>This lesson notwithstanding, bosses just cannot shake the need to shake hands. In 2021 the urge reached fever-pitch: a record $5.9trn-worth of deals were announced globally, $3.8trn by operating companies and the balance by private-equity funds and special-purpose acquisition companies (see chart). Competition for assets was fierce and due diligence frenetic. The cost of capital was historically low and purchasers paid top-notch prices, at a record median valuation of 15.4-times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (<small>ebitda</small>), according to Bain, a consultancy. The number of deals for highly-valued technology firms soared, accounting for a quarter of the total volume.</p><p>If history is any judge, many of these deals will destroy value. It is easy to identify disastrous deals: large goodwill write-downs or even bankruptcy are useful signposts. But measuring the performance of the average deal is tough; relative share price performance is a quick but noisy measure and asking a counterfactual “what if” question is crystal-ball stuff. A recent review of academic literature by Geoff and J. Gay Meeks at Cambridge University estimates that only a fifth of studies conclude that the average deal produces higher combined profits or increases the wealth of the acquirer’s shareholders. McKinsey, another consultancy, reckons that firms pursuing large deals between 2010 and 2019 had only a coin-flip chance of creating excess shareholder returns. Enough to put average Joes off dealmaking, but not budding Neutron Jacks. </p><p>Those chances of success are further reduced by the circumstances in which the latest crop of deals were struck. Times of frenzy, like last year, are particularly bad for matching suitable buyers and sellers. Dealmaking tends to snowball as chief executives, keen to expand their dominions (and compensation), watch others make their moves and are unable to stand idly by while competitors make hay. Unprecedented competition from private-equity funds only intensifies the urge to move fast. Compounding their zeal are the middlemen. Investment bankers, who get paid by the deal rather than by the hour, convince them anything is possible: flattery is hard currency in the market for advice.</p><p>There are few brakes on this train. Where activist investors might agitate on the sell-side of a transaction for a higher price (often successfully), this kind of scrutiny is less common on the buy-side. Strong shareholder dissent in reaction to Unilever’s abortive $66bn bid for <small>gsk</small>’s consumer health-care division in December 2021 is an all-too-rare example of owners holding trigger-happy management to account. Today the division, called Haleon, is listed on the London Stock Exchange, valued at around half of Unilever’s offer.</p></div><p>The result has been ambitious deals made at high prices.

The key strategic questions you face are not whether combinations such as these are necessary but, rather, how will they create value, and how are you going to capture that value? How are these ventures going to enhance your competitive position? Whether you are at the top of the company driving the remix, in the middle managing an acquisition or a partnership, or among the operating ranks keeping the pieces humming, you need to know the answers to such questions.</p> \n<p>In my work with executives, I’ve noticed a distinct gap in their toolkits.

The strength of these playbooks is their concrete detail about the legal, managerial, and ﬁnancial ins and outs of every deal type and the tips on how to manage people and cultures in these combinations on a day-to-day basis. But managers lack a set of guiding principles for actually making the deal create value for the company. Based on my 30 years of consulting, teaching, and academic research on partnership strategy, I have created a simple but powerful framework to help executives see clearly the key decisions that drive value creation and capture, and then to navigate those decisions successfully.

Disney leveraged Pixar’s computer-generated characters across its network, while Pixar gained Disney’s expertise in marketing and merchandizing its characters.</p>\n<p>But not all corporate marriages are successful in matching different strengths. More than 60 percent of corporate alliances fail to create value; yet, the merger mania refuses to die.<sup><a href="#endnote-1">1</a></sup> After all, they may provide an opportunity to acquire technology assets, expand and diversify products or services, increase economies of scale and value efficiency, and/or enlarge the customer base in existing as well as new geographic markets.</p>\n<p>Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) in the United States came in waves in sync with economic growth and uncertainties associated with rapid globalization, changing demand, and rapid technology transformation. With economic activity picking up and the labor market tightening, US growth seems to be showing signs of "green shoots” lately, and it is likely that the next big M&amp;A wave is here.</p>\n<h2>The M&amp;A waves of 1990s and 2000s</h2>\n<p>Figure 1 shows the number of nonfarm M&amp;A deals announced each year in the United States.<sup><a href="#endnote-2">2</a></sup> The wave in the 1990s was particularly remarkable because of the size of deals as well as the number of cross-border alliances relative to the previous decades.<sup><a href="#endnote-3">3</a></sup> Between 1991 and 1998, the total number of nonfarm M&amp;A deals jumped by 133 percent, with 1998 witnessing the highest number of deals ever made in the history of the United States.</p>\n<p>Following the East-Asian crisis during 1997–98 and the dot-com bubble in 2001–02, the number of deals collapsed and remained relatively low until 2002, when takeover deals accelerated again at an aggressive pace, primarily driven by US companies. The years between 2002 and 2006 saw several mega-billion M&amp;A deals, such as the one between Pixar and Disney. Before the onset of the global financial crisis, the number of deals peaked at 9,911 in 2007, worth $14.6 billion.</p>\n<p>M&amp;A activity slumped again following the financial crisis in 2008, only to revive at a moderate pace during the recovery. It was not until 2014 that the activity gathered steam; the number of deals surged to 9,303 in 2015, close to pre-crisis levels. After a momentary breather in the first three quarters of 2016, likely owing to uncertainty arising from the Brexit referendum and US elections, M&amp;A activity revived in the fourth quarter. That made 2016 the second-best year in terms of M&amp;A deals since the crisis.

Surprisingly, when US companies were shying away from making investments between 1998 and 2001, global companies were participating in larger numbers in acquiring US businesses. At the peak of the dot-com crisis, the share of M&amp;A deals by global companies rose to a fifth of the total deals.

(55, 'Mergers and Acquisitions - Nonprofit Style', 'https://www.lehmannstrobel.com/articles/mergers-and-acquisitions-nonprofit-style/', '<div><div>\n<p>Most people understand mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A for the uninitiated) as something for-profit companies do to enhance shareholder value, grow profits and consolidate operations – and improve services, products and value for consumers. A merger or acquisition may also be undertaken by not-for-profit organizations as a way to enhance services provided to the community, share limited resources, and leverage assets, including good will. Although not been widely undertaken in the past, the number of not-for-profits considering such an undertaking is increasing.</p>\n<p>It may be helpful to define “merger and acquisition” as distinguished from a “strategic alliance”. A strategic alliance is an agreement between two or more entities that endeavors to maximize resources to reach a common goal. A merger is the union of two or more organizations into one new entity, while an acquisition is one organization taking over (acquiring ownership of) another. In the case of both strategic alliances and M&amp;As, these transactions may occur between not-for-profits or between not-for-profits and for-profit businesses.</p>\n<p>Why would a not-for-profit consider an alliance or M&amp;A? Obviously, a severe recession that impacts an organization’s ability to maintain daily operations could drive these discussions. Funders who provide support to organizations with similar missions in the same market may recommend consolidation as a way of promoting sustainability while better utilizing limited dollars. Market changes, new competitive factors and changes in management leadership may also drive M&amp;A and alliance discussions.</p>\n<p>Across the country, many nonprofits are relooking at their structure, partners and competition and undergoing major strategic reorganizations. In reviewing the finalists of The Collaboration Prize, which is described below, one finds solid examples of the benefits mergers, acquisitions and alliances among not-for-profits. One “alliance” in Chattanooga resulted in the consolidation of human resources, technology, finance, marketing and retail from three museums under one, providing revenue to the Tennessee Aquarium and savings of more than $1.5 million for the Hunter Museum of American Art and the Creative Discovery Museum. The collaboration has also led to increased community visibility, and promoted more shared programming between the museums.</p>\n<p>So when should an organization consider the M&amp;A path versus a strategic alliance? For a few lucky not-for-profits, such discussions have evolved over time due to careful business planning and strong partnerships with the entity being merged, acquired, dissolved or aligned. However, many not-for-profits must consider these options under duress due to a number of factors, the primary ones being a significant loss in funding and/or insufficient working capital. Rather than view talk of consolidation or shared services as a negative, not-for-profits should view such conversations as an opportunity to provide a better service, retool basic operations and eliminate any “non-core” functions and expenses. Whether you are a senior manager or a board member of a not-for-profit, now might be an opportune time to look at these options.</p>\n<p>How does one begin the M&amp;A or alliance process? Too often, not-for-profits look only at the bottom line when beginning a discussion. Rather, not-for-profits should regularly undertake a broad business audit, or, a “due diligence” survey of organizational, legal and financial matters – including human resources, operating procedures, programming, outreach and promotion, governance, fundraising, finance and administration, compliance with state and federal laws, real estate, and intellectual property assets (including web-based content and services), among other things. Such a due diligence survey should be a tool used by not-for-profits on an annual basis for basic operations, but too often, it is developed during a less-than-opportune time. In the event of a merger, acquisition or alliance, the measurements and results of a recent due diligence assessment will speed up the process of evaluating and valuing an organization’s assets, liabilities and business processes and save valuable time for organizations that must move quickly. Preparing such a survey should be a key goal of not-for-profits as part of regular business planning, and should be undertaken with board members or consultants experienced in not-for-profit matters.</p>\n<p>Additionally, not-for-profits should create an ad hoc committee of the board of directors and key staff to identify potential partners and evaluate mergers, acquisition or alliance options. This committee can oversee the due diligence survey, and more easily reach out to community leaders, funders', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

So much so that the motto and reasoning behind mergers and acquisitions have also changed completely.

The trend is that a well-established but declining brick and mortar retailer is buying an online e-commerce company.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in the United States, chains of pharmacy stores are buying out health insurance companies. The reality is that businesses are no longer stable. Instead, they continuously change. Therefore whenever an established player finds itself lagging in some space, it used mergers and acquisitions to become competitive.

But what about the next 50?</p>\n\t\n<p>Today, the situation certainly looks bleak. Economic stagnation and widening inequality have contributed to a surge in xenophobia and nationalism in the advanced countries, exemplified by the United Kingdom’s vote to exit the European Union and the election of US President Donald Trump – and now his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. Meanwhile, large parts of the developing world – notably, the Middle East and North Africa – have been embroiled in conflict, with some teetering on the edge of state failure.</p>\n<p>But while such turbulence is likely to continue for the near future, there is little consensus on what lies beyond that. To be sure, long-run forecasting is usually a fool’s errand. In 1930, in similarly troubled times, none other than John Maynard Keynes tried his hand at it, with the famous essay “<a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/1930/our-grandchildren.htm">Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren</a>.” He got his forecast wrong.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Keynes’s attempt surely sets a respectable precedent for economic future gazing. So here I go: in 50 years, I predict that the world economy is likely (though not guaranteed) to be thriving, with global GDP growing by as much as 20% per year, and income and consumption doubling every four years or so.</p>\n<p>At first, this scenario probably seems farfetched. After all, the global economy currently is growing at a rate of just 3% annually (a bit worse, in the last few years). But it wouldn’t be the first time global economic growth accelerated to previously unimaginable levels.</p>\n<p>From 1500 to 1820, according to\xa0<a href="https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/contours-of-the-world-economy-1-2030-ad-9780199227204?cc=mx&amp;lang=en&amp;">data</a>\xa0collected by the late Angus Maddison, the world’s annual growth rate was just 0.32%, with large sections of the world experiencing no growth at all. In China, annual\xa0<i>per capita\xa0</i>income stood at $600 throughout this period. For someone living at that time, today’s disappointing 3% growth rate would have been inconceivable. How could they anticipate the Industrial Revolution, which lifted average annual global growth to 2.25% from 1820 to 2003?</p>\n<p>Today, it is the Digital Revolution that promises to lift growth to new heights. Indeed, we are in the midst of dramatic technological breakthroughs, with advances in digital technology connecting all corners of the world. As a result, workers are not just becoming more productive; they are gaining greater access to employment. Individuals in developing countries, for example, are now able to work for multinational companies. The upshot is that more workers are participating in the labor market.</p>\n<p>The economic effects of this trend have not been all positive. In the United States, for example, the average real (inflation-adjusted) wage has barely risen, even as unemployment has fallen to 4.3%. By enabling lower-wage workers abroad – and, increasingly, machines – to do more jobs, technology has reinforced this “maximum wage ceiling.”</p>\n<p>The key to breaking through this ceiling is to change the kinds of work in which people are engaged. Through improved education and training, as well as more effective redistribution, we can facilitate more creative work – from art to scientific research – which machines will not be able to do in the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>Though such work may seem wasteful, owing to the number of people and amount of time it takes to secure one major achievement or breakthrough, one such achievement or breakthrough is all it takes to create enough value to boost everybody’s standard of living. And, indeed, as the creative sector grows, growth will pick up substantially.</p>\n<p>', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

He was in no doubt that it would continue to do so. In the 1960s, the world was typically divided into a first, second, and third world. By the turn of the millennium, it was more common to talk of the “West” and the “Rest”, or even just the “Rich” and the “Rest” (Maddison\xa0<a href="http://www.oecdbookshop.org/oecd/display.asp?K=5L9ZBQKMGM20&amp;lang=EN&amp;sort=sort_date/d&amp;stem=true&amp;sf1=Title&amp;st1=The+World+Economy&amp;sf3=SubjectCode&amp;st4=not+E4+or+E5+or+P5&amp;sf4=SubVersionCode&amp;ds=The+World+Economy;+All+Subjects;+&amp;m=2&amp;dc=24&amp;plang=en">2001</a>,\xa0<a href="http://www.oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/884/">2002</a>).</p>\n<p>In a new report, the OECD Development Centre forecasts that by 2030 non-OECD economies will account for 57% of global GDP, up from just 40% in 2000 (OECD 2010). This remarkable turnaround is due to the dynamism of the developing world, in particular India and China. Combined with their large populations, this means that the economic centre of gravity of the global economy is changing rapidly, with all kinds of implications for economic policy in many spheres – macroeconomics, natural resource management, technology, agricultural, and development policy.</p>\n<p>These figures were based on the groundbreaking work of the OECD Development Centre economic historian Angus Maddison, who passed away in April 2010 (see Harry Wu’s Vox column\xa0<a href="http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/5350">remembering Maddison’s life and work</a>). Despite Maddison’s undisputed genius, he may well have underestimated the relative weight of developing countries in the global economy over the next two decades. Maddison made his forecasts on the basis of data available in 2003. Subsequent events reveal a markedly different story to the one apparent then.</p>\n<h2>Shifting wealth and the global economy</h2>\n<p>In “Contours of the World Economy 1-2030”, Maddison (2007) provided comprehensive forecasts for the global economy, based on the Geary-Kharis purchasing power parities.<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>\xa0He classified countries into two broad groups: the “Rich” countries and the “Rest” – a group of developing countries including some, such as South Korea, that are now classified as high-income due to strong growth.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>The scenarios depicted below (Table 1) include a revision of Maddison’s estimates for Asia, Latin America, and Africa.

Assume also that there has not been an energy crisis or a terminal ecological catastrophe. What is the world economy going to look like in 2050?</p><p>Quite different from the one we live in now, according to research from Karen Ward. The HSBC economist produced a global league table <a href="http://www.hsbcnet.com/gbm/global-insights/insights/2011/world-in-2050.html">a year ago</a> and the updated version has some interesting findings. China is the biggest economy, with the US sandwiched between it and India in third place, but both the big developing countries remain poor when allowance is made for population, with neither in the top 50 in terms of income per capita. By that measure, Luxembourg, Singapore and Switzerland will be the richest nations, ahead of the US (8th), Germany (10th) and Britain (14th).</p><p>Ward\'s report divides the top 100 into three categories: fast growth, growth and stable. The 26 fast-growing countries are predicted to expand by 5% or more over the next few decades and for countries such as the Philippines and Peru this will see them shoot up the league table to take places in the global top 30. The 43 growth nations are expected to grow by 3% to 5% a year, with this group including 11 Latin American nations, such as Brazil, Argentina and Chile, as well as some in eastern Europe such as Romania and the Czech Republic.</p><p>Most of the countries in the stable category are from the developed world, forecast to grow by less than 3% a year. Some of these countries are on course to see quite dramatic falls in their population: in Japan\'s case from 127 million to 102 million and in Germany\'s from 82 million to 71 million. Britain, with 72 million, will by 2050 have more people than Germany, despite being only two-thirds as big in terms of land mass.</p><p>Many European countries will see their working populations shrink drastically, suggesting that the current fiscal problems in the eurozone will persist. By contrast, Nigeria is on course to see its population more than double from 158 million to 390 million, leaving it the fourth most populous country in the world, just behind the US at 404 million.</p><p>These are, of course, only projections based on current income per capita, rule of law, democracy, education levels and demographic change. "We assume," Ward admits "that policymakers will continue to make progress in addressing economic flaws and that they avoid wars and remain open to global trade and capital."</p><p>While the HSBC economist freely accepts that some of her assumptions might not prove to be accurate, it might be worth tossing a couple of other assumptions into the mix. Global growth on this scale is going to require a lot of fuel, and it is going to be one heck of a challenge to find alternative sources of energy as supplies of fossil fuels are used up.

Economic convergence between emerging markets (EMs) and developed economies was notable mostly for its absence (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1992), and the idea that China, India and other large EMs would become dominant forces in the global economy appeared fanciful.

We think there is significant value in gathering all the information we have on these factors and incorporating that information into a coherent model for a broad range of economies.</p>\n<p>The forecast model that we use, together with the changes we have made relative to our previous projections, are discussed in detail in Daly and Gedminas (2022).</p>\n<h2>Four major themes for the global economy</h2>\n<p>In our updated projections, we identify four major themes for the global economy:</p>\n<h4>Theme #1: Slower global potential growth, led by weaker population growth</h4>\n<p>Global growth has slowed from an average of 3.6% per year in the ten years to the Global Crisis, to 3.2% per year in the decade prior to the Covid pandemic (measured on a market-weighted basis). The slowdown has been relatively broad-based, affecting both developed and emerging economies. It has reflected a combination of both slower global population growth and weaker productivity growth, with the latter appearing to be linked to a slowdown in the pace of globalisation. Our projections imply that we have passed the high-water mark of potential global growth, with growth averaging 2.8% between 2024 and 2029 and on a gradually declining path thereafter (Figure 1).</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>\xa0Global potential growth on a gradually declining path</p>\n \n<h6><em>Note</em>:\xa0Global GDP growth; solid line - 5Y centred average; dotted line - annual growth.<br /><em>Source</em>: GS (2022); IMF</h6>\n<p>Most of this projected slowdown is due to demographics. Global population growth has halved over the past 50 years, from around 2% per year to less than 1% currently, and UN population projections imply that it will fall close to zero by 2075 (Figure 2). While some of this slowdown had previously been anticipated, population projections are also being revised lower (the global population is now expected to peak at around 10 billion people, having previously been expected to rise to more than 11bn). This is a ‘good problem’ to have, in that reducing global population growth is a necessary condition for long-term environmental sustainability. Nevertheless, this adjustment to weaker population growth and ageing populations presents several economic challenges (most notably, from rising healthcare and retirement costs). The number of developed and EM economies for which population ageing represents a serious economic challenge is likely to rise steadily over the coming decades.</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 2\xa0</strong>Global population growth has halved since the 1960', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

The expected long-term returns for U.S. equities clustered in the low-single-digit range, and expectations for fixed-income returns were even lower thanks to ultralow starting yields.</p> <p>Six months, an equity bear market, and a series of interest-rate increases later, however, and the forecasts for stock and bond returns are generally looking up among the firms that have updated their forecasts to reflect recent market action. While most firms still expect better returns from non-U.S. stocks than U.S. names over the next decade, U.S. return expectations have improved markedly as stocks have fallen. And because starting yields are closely correlated with subsequent bond total returns, the expectations for bond returns have also increased, though they\'re nothing to write home about in absolute terms, especially on an inflation-adjusted basis.</p> <h2>How to Use Them</h2> <p>While it\'s almost impossible to guess the market\'s direction on a short-term basis, return expectations can be useful—and are arguably even mission-critical—when setting up your financial plan. After all, you need to plug in some type of long-term return assumption when deciding whether your savings rate and time horizon are appropriate given what you\'d like to achieve. And if you\'re retired, being realistic about return expectations is also essential when determining an appropriate withdrawal rate.</p> <p>Before you take these or any other return forecasts and run with them, however, it\'s important to bear in mind that these return estimates are more intermediate-term than they are long. The firms I\'ve included below all prepare capital markets forecasts for the next seven to 10 years, not the next 30. (BlackRock does provide a 30-year forecast, but it\'s an outlier in terms of making such far-reaching forecasts available to the public.) As such, these forecasts will have the most relevance for investors whose time horizons are in that ballpark, or for new retirees who face sequence-of-return risk in the next decade. Investors with very long time horizons (20-30 years or longer) can reasonably employ long-term historical returns.</p> <p>It\'s also important to note that the parameters for these return estimates vary a bit; some of the return expectations are inflation-adjusted, while most are not (nominal). In addition, some of the experts forecast returns for the next decade, while others employ slightly shorter time horizons. </p> <p>"As of" dates also vary, though I focused on those that came out in the first or second half of 2022. The firms also vary in their approaches to formulating the forecasts, though most rely on some combination of valuations, current yields, earnings growth, and inflation expectations. Finally, it\'s worth noting that the market is always moving, so expect these forecasts to be pretty ephemeral, too.</p> <p> </p> <p><a href="https://www.blackrock.com/institutions/en-us/insights/charts/capital-market-assumptions">BlackRock</a>\xa0<br /> Highlights: A 7.1% 10-year expected nominal return from U.S. large-cap equities; 8.3% 10-year average expected return from European large-cap equities; 9.0% average expected return from emerging-markets large-cap equities; and 3.0% for U.S. aggregate bonds (as of April 2022). All return assumptions are nominal (non-inflation-adjusted).</p> <p>BlackRock\'s asset-class return forecasts are often among the most optimistic of those we gather, and its April 2022 numbers are no exception. Not surprisingly, the firm\'s outlook for most major asset classes has trended up since its 2021 release. European large-cap equities are a notable exception, however. While the firm was forecasting a 9.2% 10-year annualized return from such stocks back in September 2021, that number dropped to 8.3% as of April of this year. The firm\'s highest return forecast is for private equity—13%—albeit with a huge amount of variability around that figure.</p> <p><a href="https://www.gmo.com/globalassets/', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')
(74, 'Summary', 'https://seekingalpha.com/article/3938506-poor-future-returns-ahead-according-to-ten-years-of-highly-accurate-predictions', '<div><div><p>Can any one indicator predict, with a generally high degree of accuracy, whether stocks are going to do well or poorly over the next several years? Ditto for bonds? Most people would probably think not.</p> <p>Therefore, if you as an investor were to come across two such indicators, you would have to assess whether their successful results were indeed valid and likely to foretell future results, or on the other hand, perhaps be attributable merely to luck or chance, and essentially non-repeatable.</p> <p>Part of the obvious difficulty in finding such indicators is that both overall stock and bond prices cannot be attributable or influenced a single factor alone but a great number of factors. These factors interact, sometimes as might be expected, but at other times, differently, creating outcomes that few would have predicted.</p> <p>Some of these factors entail how certain aspects of the economy are functioning, but others would defy a straightforward relationship with the investing universe. Rather, the latter would likely require an estimate of hard to anticipate "psychological" factors that cause investors to either "love" or "hate" stocks and bonds, often over significant periods of time. At least, this is the conclusion I, and others, such as 2013 Economics Nobel Prize winner Robert Shiller have come to. In my case, this comes after approximately three decades of studying the movements of stock and bond prices and trying to understand what influences them.</p> <p>Given this, "single-dimensional" predictors of stock and bond prices are unlikely to be consistently successful, whether they be interest rates, gross domestic product, P/E ratios, consumer sentiment, or you name it. Instead, I\'d rather study as many of the subfactors that potentially affect investment performance and come up with my own approximate assessment of potential future performance, even as highly subjective as that might appear.</p> <p>Narrowing this down further to a "composite" measure which might serve to help me predict future stock as well as bond performance might appear to be a nearly impossible task. But I will now present considerable evidence to the contrary. Specifically, the two measures I have come up with, one for stocks and one for bonds, have now been shown to have an impressive record going back to 2005. Note: Similar results were reported by me a little more than <a href="http://funds-newsletter.com/feb15-newsletter/feb15-new.htm">a year ago</a> and even <a href="http://funds-newsletter.com/apr11-newsletter/apr11.htm%22">five years ago</a>, and since then, new data continue to support the same findings. Of course, there can be no guarantees that these predictions will continue to prove accurate looking forward.</p> <p><b>Successful Stock and Bond Index Predictors Might Not Come From Where You Would Expect</b></p> <p>What I am referring to as "predictors" were not initially meant to be used to predict how the overall stock or bond markets would do. Rather, they were designed as recommendations, re-evaluated each calendar quarter, as to how much of a "moderate risk" investor\'s portfolio should be allocated to stocks and how much to bonds in my Newsletter\'s model portfolios. But, in a real sense, a relatively high allocation to stocks vs. bonds (or cash) should generally equate to an expectation that stocks will do relatively well, and the same for bonds. Likewise, relatively low allocations to either should generally suggest the opposite.</p> <p>Regarding a high or low allocation to stocks (or bonds), investors must ask what is the time frame involved. For example, in recommending a 100% allocation to stocks, does this mean one predicts stocks are going to be the best investment over the next few months, years, or over a lifetime? Each assumption has a totally different implication for judging the eventual success of the prediction.</p> <p>Again supposing an advisor recommends a 100% allocation to stocks. Question: Does this imply that he is quite bullish on the future prospects for stocks? Answer: Likely perhaps, but not necessarily. While this might be a logical conclusion, it only necessarily implies that he thinks stocks prospects are <i>relatively</i> better than the remaining alternatives, but not necessarily "high" in an <i>absolute</i> sense. For example: While stocks prospects might not be particularly bright, a 100% allocation would still make sense if one estimated that bond and/or cash returns were going to be even less.

The 10-year Treasury yield passed 3.5% last week for the first time since 2011, up from just\xa01.2% in the summer of 2021.\xa0And bond prices have dropped accordingly. The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index has dropped over 12% so far this year, and longer-term bonds have dropped further still. Long-term Treasuries, for example, have shed about 25% for the year to date through Sept. 21, 2022, on top of a 5% drop last year. </p> <p>The question is, what, if anything, should you do to prepare your portfolio for rising interest rates? A good bit of the Fed\'s likely activity is already priced into stocks and bonds, and it\'s rarely a good idea to be too reactive or to position your portfolio for all-or-nothing scenarios. Interest rates could climb sharply in the years ahead, or they could flatline or even reverse course if the economy slows and/or the Fed\'s rate increases have their desired effect of taming inflation.</p> <p>At the same time, you also want to be prepared. Growth stocks and long-term bonds have all lost value recently, but over the long term they\'ve benefited from the fact that interest rates have remained low for decades. Given that many investors are inclined to be hands-off with their portfolios, it\'s possible that they\'re heavy on the very market segments that have been getting clocked recently.</p> <p>The goal is to strike a balance: Even as some of your holdings may experience losses in the face of interest-rate changes, others may be beneficiaries. As you survey how your portfolio might respond in a rising-interest-rate environment, here are the key items to keep on your dashboard. </p> <h2>Bonds: A Duration Check</h2> <p>High-quality bond prices tend to respond immediately, and negatively, to anticipated interest-rate changes. Thus, they\'re a logical first stop if you\'re assessing how your portfolio is apt to behave in a rising-rate environment.</p> <p>To help address the vulnerability of your bond-fund holdings when rates go up, I recommend <a href="/articles/715053">the duration stress test I wrote about earlier this year</a>. Your fund\'s duration minus its SEC yield is roughly the amount you would expect it to lose in a one-year period in which interest rates jumped by 1 percentage point.\xa0As the Fed has hiked interest rates by 3 percentage points this year, it\'s no wonder that many intermediate- and long-term funds have lost multiples of their durations so far this year.\xa0</p> <p>As you conduct this exercise, bear in mind that your funds\' returns are already reflecting the bond market\'s best guess about the Fed\'s likely actions. If and when the Fed moves to lift interest rates, your holdings won\'t necessarily experience another set of large price declines on top of the losses they\'ve already racked up.</p> <p>For that reason, it\'s probably not a great idea to dump all of your intermediate-term bond holdings in favor of short-term, or switch from bonds to cash. Simply put, you\'re probably too late, and doing so would be akin to saying that you know better than the bond market about what might happen with interest rates from here. Moreover, starting yields are a good approximation of what you\'re likely to earn from bonds over the next decade: Because of their higher starting yields, intermediate-term bonds are likely to earn more than short-term bonds, and short-term bonds more than cash.</p> <p>But the duration stress test is a way to ensure that you understand the volatility your your holdings could face in a rising-rate environment and that your time horizon is appropriate given the potential for short-term losses. For near-term cash outlays—money for your bills during retirement over the next year or two, next semester\'s tuition payment, or a new roof you may need tomorrow—there\'s only one asset class that reliably stays positive (at least on a before-inflation basis): cash.

Not only is there the risk of political upheaval, but currency exchange rates often <a href="https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/3-emerging-market-stocks-to-cushion-fed-hikes/">play a role</a> in how these markets function. That aside, the emerging markets offer a wealth of opportunity for investors, and 2023 looks like a good time to get into the game. Emerging markets are characterized by low-to-middle income per capita and fast earnings growth. The takeaway is that this combination leads to a healthy consumer and increased consumption, which drives these markets.\xa0</p>\n<h2>Emerging Markets Have a High Growth Potential\xa0</h2>\n<p>Emerging markets come with a high growth potential. The rapid advancement of income, spending, infrastructure growth, and inflation combine to produce world-leading growth. The outlook for EMs in 2023 is for expansion to <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDP_RPCH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD/GUY/SUR/BRA/COL">triple the developed world </a>and deliver competitive returns for investors. Guyana, a neighbor to Brazil, is expected to have the hottest growth this year, about 38%.\xa0</p>\n<p>Guyana is supported by record oil reserves discovered in 2015. The discoveries put Guyana\'s resources at roughly 1/3rd of global reserves, which is a highly significant figure. With oil prices rising, Guyana can<a href="https://oilnow.gy/featured/guyana-tops-list-of-five-fastest-growing-economies-up-to-2026/"> expect its growth to continue </a>well into 2024. As it is, the country will double in GDP between 2022 and 2024 and is expected to sustain a high double-digit pace for the next several years and top the list of fastest-growing countries. Growth will be driven by oil but is not tied to it completely. The country\'s current leadership is working to diversify the economic base, including a lean into education to improve its workforce. Non-oil growth is running near 5% for Guyana, which is also above the expected global average for 2023.\xa0</p>\n<h2>Get Ultimate Diversification with Emerging Markets\xa0</h2>\n<p>Diversifying with US equities and investments is possible but incomplete without emerging markets. Emerging markets not only give exposure to other countries and political environments but can also help offset the impacts of FX conversions. Emerging markets will benefit when the <a href="https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSEARCA/SPY/"><strong>S&amp;P 500 NYSEARCA: SPY </strong></a>suffers from FX headwinds. As it is now, the FOMC is on track to continue hiking rates in 2023 and may do so more than 1 more time. This has the dollar index rising and strengthening the FX headwind for US companies. Meanwhile, emerging market central banks were less hesitant to hike rates when inflation spiked and are closer to cutting rates now. That split will provide an economic boost for emerging economies.\xa0</p><br />\n<h2>China Policy Shifts Support EM Growth\xa0</h2>\n<p>Believe it or not, as big as it is, China is still an emerging market and significantly affects emerging market growth in 2023 and 2024.

Broadly speaking, an economy that is not too rich, not too poor and not too closed to foreign capital. The term was coined by Antoine van Agtmael in 1981 when he was working for the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a division of the World Bank. He hoped to create what he had named: a set of promising stockmarkets, lifted from obscurity, thereby attracting the investment they needed to thrive.</p><p>At the time, it was hard work even to compare the performance of stockmarkets in places like Brazil, India and South Korea. The IFC, having collected data on ten such markets, felt that foreign investors might take to these boondock bourses, but would be put off by the risk of investing in a single company or the trouble of diversifying across many firms and places. The answer, the IFC concluded, was to provide them with a one-stop, broadly representative “Third-World Equity Fund”. When Mr Agtmael pitched the idea to a group of fund managers at an event hosted by Salomon Brothers, some were sceptical, other intrigued. One liked the idea but hated the name. So Mr Agtmael spent the weekend dreaming up the term “emerging markets”, with which he hoped to evoke “progress, uplift and dynamism”. That label proved wildly successful.</p><p>The first such fund, pioneered by Capital Group in 1986, included only four countries. The most popular equity benchmark, the MSCI EM index, started in 1988 with ten and now spans 24. Many people complain that the category has become an indiscriminate grab-bag, throwing together economies at utterly different stages of development, such as Taiwan and Pakistan. But the group was never all that homogeneous. The ten markets in the original MSCI index included the Philippines but also Portugal, a country seven times as rich (at market exchange rates). Indeed, the markets are now more tightly correlated than they were in the early years, according to MSCI (though less so than in the crisis years from 2008 to 2013).</p><figure><div><p></p></div></figure><p>The emerging-markets group has also become more prosperous and more Asian. The World Bank now classifies nine of MSCI’s 24 benchmark economies as high-income. (These economies, which include Taiwan, South Korea, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and several members of the European Union, will not feature prominently in this special report.) Asia accounts for almost 70% of the group’s combined GDP and commands a similar weight in the equity index. From Hong Kong “I can cover 60% of the market cap within four hours’ flight,” says Sean Taylor of Deutsche Bank Asset Management.</p><p>Some countries are much more important to investors than their economic weight would suggest, thanks to their unusually deep and open stock- or debt markets. The best example is South Africa: the combined value of shares on its stockmarket is more than three times its GDP. The biggest company listed on its stockmarket is Naspers, mainly because it has a 33% stake in Tencent, a Chinese internet giant.</p><p>As well as progress, uplift and dynamism, emerging markets have traditionally featured crises, defaults and slumps. Many have been laid low by profligate governments, overstretched companies, mismatched balance-sheets, fickle foreign capital or volatile commodity prices. Such setbacks can take a toll on their long-term prospects, preventing them from graduating to the ranks of mature markets. Poor economies typically become “emerging markets” because they have grown quickly. They remain “emerging” because they have not managed to grow steadily.</p></div><p>This article appeared in the Special report section of the print edition under the headline "What’s in a name?"</p><div><div><figure></figure></div><div><h3>From the October 7th 2017 edition</h3><p>Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents </p><a href="https://www.economist.com/printedition/2017-10-07">Explore the edition</a></div></div></div>', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

As international stocks in general have fallen behind the U.S. market for more than a decade, emerging markets, which are generally defined as countries that have lower levels of income per capita and are making the transition to become more developed, have been even weaker.</p><p>Over the trailing 15-year period through June 30, 2023, the Morningstar Emerging Markets Index has generated annualized returns of just 3.1% per year, compared with 4.1% for the Morningstar DM xUS Index. The picture looks even worse over the past 12 months. As developed-markets stocks have rallied to a 17.1% gain, emerging-markets stocks have gained just 4%. As a result, diversified emerging-markets funds (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) have suffered about $8.9 billion in net outflows for the trailing 12-month period through May 2023.</p><p>These disappointing results notwithstanding, there are still valid arguments for investing in emerging-markets stocks. In this article, I’ll look at risk-adjusted returns over longer periods, as well as other reasons investors may not want to give up on emerging markets just yet.</p><h2>The Rise and Fall of Emerging Markets</h2><p>By definition, emerging markets should have greater growth potential than more established equity markets. As mentioned above, emerging markets generally produce less economic output relative to the size of their populations. As these countries become more industrialized and integrated with the global economy, rapid economic growth can follow, often accompanied by robust equity-market returns.</p><p>That is exactly what happened in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index dates back to the end of 1987, just as global economies were opening up and investment capital was flowing into markets that were formerly unavailable. As a result, rolling three-year returns for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index trounced more-developed markets by healthy margins through over most periods up until early 1995.</p><figure> <p></p> <figcaption>Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. </figcaption></figure><p>The trend reversed in the mid-1990s following the Mexican peso crisis in December 1994 and the Asian currency crisis in 1997. Emerging markets fell behind their developed counterparts from 1994 through 1998, and lagged again in the tech correction in 2000. Driven by robust economic growth in China and rising global commodity prices, emerging markets then entered a secular bull market that lasted until the global financial crisis in 2008.</p><p>After staging a strong (albeit partial) recovery in 2009 and 2010, emerging markets ran hot and cold in the following years. Both 2013 and 2021 stand out as examples of what can go wrong. Emerging-markets stocks fell about 17 percentage points behind developed-market issues in 2013, when the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it planned to slow down its bond-buying program and tighten monetary policy. They fell out of favor again in 2021 because of market worries over slower economic growth and regulatory uncertainty in China, which makes up about 30% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.</p><p>These dramatic swings in performance were accompanied by above-average risk levels. As shown in the table below, standard deviation for the emerging-markets benchmark has been about 30% higher than that of developed markets since 1988, and emerging markets have also been subject to more extreme drawdown risk. Recovery times have been prolonged, as well. After the painful drawdown during the global financial crisis, for example, emerging markets didn’t fully recover until nearly 10 years later.</p><figure> <p></p> <figcaption>Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. </figcaption></figure><p>However, emerging markets’ volatility has been partly offset by their relatively low correlations with U.S. markets. The correlation coefficient between emerging markets and the U.S. equity market has averaged about 0.66 since performance data started in 1988. As a result, adding emerging markets to a globally diversified portfolio (including both U.S. and non-U.S. stocks) has led to better risk-adjusted returns more often than not. To test this, I created two separate portfolios: One with a 30% stake in developed-market stocks and the remainder in U.S. equities, and the other with a 20% stake in developed-market stocks, 10% in emerging markets, and the remainder in U.S. equities.

He noted the MSCI All Country World Ex-US Index, which is currently around 28% emerging markets.

That valuation gap, in simple terms, is price to earnings and other measures of company value. In other words, often an American investor is paying less to buy a Brazilian top tier bank than they are when buying an American one.</p>\n<p>Patience, and a bit of timing, are imperative here. A 25-year-old should be more heavily invested in emerging markets than a retiree. “The longer the horizon an investor has, the greater their exposure should be,” Vaughn says.</p>\n<p>Between 2016 and 2022, the <strong>iShares</strong><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EEM/history"><strong> </strong></a><strong>MSCI Emerging Markets Index</strong> (EEM) rose roughly 50%, beating the FTSE Europe Index.

And when you invest internationally, you have the opportunity to invest in both developed markets and emerging markets.\xa0</p>\n<p>There’s no standard metric for differentiating between developed markets and emerging markets, but there are a number of identifiable characteristics that are hallmarks of each, says Dan Eye, CFA, head of <a href="https://www.acorns.com/learn/investing/asset-allocation">asset allocation</a> and equity research at Roof Advisory Group, a division of Fort Pitt Capital Group.\xa0</p>\n<p>For instance, developed nations have more advanced economies, better-developed infrastructure, more mature capital markets, and higher standards of living. These are the most economically advanced countries, with highly developed capital markets, regulatory bodies and high household incomes. Most developed markets are located in North America, Western Europe and Australasia. They include countries like the United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.\xa0</p>\n<p>Emerging markets, on the other hand, are in the process of rapid growth and development but they have lower household incomes and capital markets that are less mature than developed countries. They are characterized by fast economic growth but their infrastructure and household incomes haven’t caught up yet.\xa0</p>\n<p>“Emerging countries tend to exhibit higher economic growth rates driven by younger populations, higher consumption levels, modernization of infrastructure, and integration with the global economy,” Eye says. “Emerging nations also tend to experience higher levels of political and economic instability.”</p>\n<p>Currently, emerging markets include the so-called “BRIC” countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), as well as Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain.\xa0</p>\n<h2>What are the best ways to invest in both emerging and developed markets?\xa0</h2>\n<p>Investing internationally is a smart financial move, but it can be scary to invest your money in companies and regions that are completely unfamiliar to you. One of the easiest ways to incorporate stocks from both developed markets and emerging markets is to purchase shares in managed funds. (For instance, <a href="https://www.acorns.com/invest/?s1=money_basics?s2=emerging_versus_developed_markets">Acorns portfolios</a> include emerging market and developed market <a href="https://www.acorns.com/learn/investing/what-are-index-funds">index funds</a> like the <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/pub/Pdf/sp964.pdf?2210140128">Vanguard Emerging Market Stock Index Fund</a> and the <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/pub/Pdf/sp936.pdf?2210142607">Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets Index Fund</a>.)\xa0</p>\n<p>Such funds are especially attractive to those interested in investing in emerging countries but nervous about immature capital markets. “U.S.-based investors tend to avoid the headaches and hurdles associated with direct investments in emerging market stocks and opt for exposure to the <a href="https://www.acorns.com/learn/investing/asset-classes">asset class</a> via passive <a href="https://www.acorns.com/learn/investing/what-is-an-etf">exchange-traded funds</a> or actively managed <a href="https://www.acorns.com/learn/investing/index-funds-vs-mutual-funds">mutual funds</a>,” Eye says. “Passive ETFs offer investors the benefits of broad diversification and very low investment expenses.”\xa0</p>\n<h2>Are there risks involved with investing in emerging markets?</h2>\n<p>There are always risks involved in any investment. But the risks of investing in emerging markets are unique, such as risks associated with political and economic instability.

Although the term is widespread, there is no one agreed upon definition.</p>\n<p>Here are some clarifications that may be helpful:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Most experts agree the term “emerging market investments” refers to countries or regions undergoing fast economic growth.</li>\n <li>A formula using a country’s gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita income is often used to determine if a country is an emerging market.</li>\n <li>The BRIC countries — Brazil, Russia, India and China — are examples of developing economies with explosive growth in the past decade.</li>\n <li>Some emerging markets such as South Korea have a large number of consumers and a wealthy economy.</li>\n <li>Others such as areas of Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa are still in the early stages of developing a strong economy and stable environment.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n \n <div>\n<h2>Advantages\xa0of investing in emerging markets</h2>\n<p>You may be asking yourself, "Why invest in emerging markets?" Here are two potential advantages to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Growth.</strong>\xa0The biggest advantage of emerging market investments is the potential for high growth.</li>\n <li><strong>Diversification.</strong>\xa0International investments can be a good diversifier for your investment portfolio because economic downturns in one country or region, including the U.S., can be offset by growth in another.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Risks of investing in emerging markets</h2>\n<p>Experts often categorize emerging market risk in three ways:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Political risk.</strong>\xa0Emerging markets may have unstable, even volatile, governments. Political unrest can cause serious consequences to the economy and investors.</li>\n <li><strong>Economic risk.</strong>\xa0These markets may often suffer from insufficient labor and raw materials, high inflation or deflation, unregulated markets and unsound monetary policies. All of these factors can present challenges to investors.</li>\n <li><strong>Currency risk.</strong>\xa0The value of emerging market currencies compared to the dollar can be extremely volatile. Any investment gains can be potentially lessened if a currency is devalued or drops significantly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The role of emerging markets in retirement planning</h2>\n<p>Your tolerance for risk and how your current investment portfolio is allocated can be important factors in deciding if emerging markets should be part of your retirement planning.

So, it’s easy to forget the cardinal rule that marks many a bull market: <strong>Tech still rules the world.</strong></p>\n<p>Here’s a little news flash. Tech stocks have entered <strong>a brand-new bull market</strong> that could be the start of <em>a massive 50%-plus melt-up</em>. And certain tech plays could see a <strong><u>10X surge higher!</u></strong></p>\n<p>The reason behind this is deceptively simple.</p>\n<p>Tech stocks have been getting slammed all year long. The sector gave back roughly 30%, while many individual names plunged 70% or more.</p>\n<p>That selloff had nothing to do with fundamentals. Everywhere, folks are still using technology to do everything. They’re still all shopping on <strong>Amazon</strong> (<strong><a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/amzn-stock-quote/">AMZN</a></strong>). They’re still watching <strong>Netflix</strong> (<strong><a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/nflx-stock-quote/">NFLX</a></strong>), buying <strong>Apple</strong> (<strong><a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/aapl-stock-quote/">AAPL</a></strong>) products, and working with <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<strong><a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/msft-stock-quote/">MSFT</a></strong>) software.</p>\n<p>Tech stocks were crushed because of this little thing called inflation. Indeed, that became a big problem in 2022 – for the first time in 50 years.</p>\n<p>But that big problem is starting to fade. For months, the Fed has been hiking rates aggressively to combat it. And now there are murmurs of a pivot in the near future.</p>\n<p>Plus, we’re seeing indicators flashing all across the market, signaling that the bottoming process has begun. All fundamental, technical, and sentimental evidence points to this new bull market being the real deal.</p>\n<p>If that’s true, the data says tech stocks will rip higher by 50% over the next 12 months. In fact, dozens of select tech stocks should rally by 1,000% or more.</p>\n<p>And we’ve found <strong>one tech stock we think can rally 10X before the year’s end</strong>…</p>\n<p>In other words, investors who buy the top tech stocks today will make fortunes over the next 12 months.</p>\n<p><strong>Let’s make sure you’re one of them.</strong></p>\n<h2>Indicators Signal the Formation of a New Bull Market</h2>\n<p>The first signal flashing brightly – valuations. Without a deep recession, bear markets tend to bottom around 14 to 16X forward earnings. And recently, stocks have reached about 15X – very close to that bottoming level.</p>\n<p>The second thing we’re watching is financial conditions. Bloomberg’s financial conditions index – which takes yields, stock prices, commodity prices, etc., into account – dropped below -1 a few weeks ago. Over the past 25 years, when that index falls beneath -1, stocks are close to a bottom.</p>\n<p>The third? The S&amp;P’s price is well below analysts’ price targets, about 23% below consensus. Historically, the market bottom when the S&amp;P was 20% to 30% below analyst targets. That’s bullish.</p>\n<p>Another indicator – fund managers have record-high levels of cash.

The sector now accounts for 24.2% of the S&amp;P 500. Communication services, which is home to tech-oriented leaders such as Alphabet (<a href="/stocks/xnas/googl/quote">GOOGL</a>), Facebook (<a href="/stocks/xnas/meta/quote">FB</a>), and Twitter , made up another 11% of the benchmark as of Oct. 31, 2020. Tech leaders have dominated returns for the index for seven years running; as a result, the largest companies in the index are all big tech names, including Apple (<a href="/stocks/xnas/aapl/quote">AAPL</a>), Microsoft (<a href="/stocks/xnas/msft/quote">MSFT</a>), Amazon.com (<a href="/stocks/xnas/amzn/quote">AMZN</a>), and Facebook. (Amazon is officially part of the consumer cyclical sector, but obviously tech-related.) Those five companies alone now account for about 23% of the index’s value. </p> <p>Because the S&amp;P 500 is such a widely used benchmark, thousands of index funds, exchange-traded funds, and actively managed funds also have large amounts of exposure to the tech sector. While there are good reasons behind tech’s growing dominance, it also warrants a bit of caution. In this article, I’ll delve into what’s been driving the surge in tech stocks, why this is potentially problematic for investors, and how to adjust your portfolio to mitigate the risk. </p> <p><strong>The Rising Tide</strong><br /> Over the past 31 years, the tech sector’s weighting has nearly tripled as a percentage of the S&amp;P 500. Over that period, the weighting has been as low as 6.3% (at the end of 1992) and as high as 33.0% (in August 2000). The high-water mark in 2000, of course, marked the beginning of the end of the tech bubble, when hundreds of Internet startups with inflated valuations quickly dropped down to earth. More established tech names held up better but also experienced significant drops. Between 2000 and the end of 2003, Morningstar’s U.S. Technology Index lost more than 70% of its value in cumulative terms.</p> <p> </p> <p> Since then, the sector has steadily climbed, suffering only a temporary drop during the fourth quarter of 2018’s market jitters. Tech stocks even held up better than average when the novel coronavirus roiled the market in March 2020. More recently, some market pundits have even gone so far as to describe technology as a safe haven. </p> <p> <strong>No Worries?</strong><br /> The size of any sector’s weighting in itself doesn’t necessarily mean a correction is imminent. Market valuations represent the collective wisdom of market participants about the underlying value of each company. As the nature of the economy evolves, so do the relative weightings of each sector. If we look back in time to the 1800s, agriculture made up more than a third of all economic output in the United States, gradually dropping to about 20% by the year 1900. Similarly, railroads made up about two thirds of the stocks included in the S&amp;P 500 Composite Index in the 1870s but made up only a small fraction of all holdings included when the S&amp;P 500 was launched in 1957, with the remainder made up of industrials and utilities stocks. </p> <p> Many of the more recent shifts in sector weightings also reflect changes in the nature of the economy. We can look at sector weightings going back to September 1989 (the earliest date for Morningstar’s sector data) to see how the overall makeup of “the market” has shifted over time. Over the past 31 years, old-economy sectors, such as basic materials, energy, consumer goods, and industrials, have all declined, while technology, healthcare, communication services, and financial services have increased in percentage terms. </p> <p> </p> <p> To a large extent, these changes reflect the underlying economic contributions of each company. If we aggregate all of the financial statements for the companies included in the S&amp;P 500, for example, the tech sector accounts', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Digital chips are big, highly sophisticated marvels of engineering that can calculate incredible things via the binary system of ones and zeros. The problem is, they can\'t do anything by themselves. Our real world does not consist of ones and zeroes but of temperatures, altitudes, velocities, smells and much more. To get these real-world signals into the digital world we need analog chips to convert from real-world to binary and back to real-world signals.</p> <p>I\'ll use the automotive industry as an example, which is changing rapidly in a few different directions. First, we have the switch from internal-combustion engine (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ICE">ICE</a>) vehicles to electric vehicles ((EVs)). <a href="https://www.idtechex.com/en/research-article/ev-power-electronics-driving-semiconductor-demand-in-a-chip-shortage/24820">According to idTechEx</a>, an EV will require around 2.3 times as many semiconductors as an ICE (see picture below). This tailwind gets amplified if we look at the <a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/autonomous-vehicle-market">market trends in autonomous vehicles</a>, which are expected to grow from $94 billion in 2021 to $1808 billion in 2030, an incredible 38% CAGR.</p> <p>Cars are turning more and more into giant supercomputers, and while this means that they require very powerful digital computing chips, it also means that they need an exponentially higher amount of sensors, switches, and power management chips as well. If we add that on top of the 2.3x from the ICE to EV transition we can easily see the semiconductor contents of 2030 being 3x-5x of a 2022 car.</p> <p>Texas Instruments is focused on analog chips (77% of revenue) and continues to switch its sales mix to the more favorable end markets of automotive (21%, up from 12% in 2013) and industrial (41%, up from 30% in 2013). Nvidia is also supplying the automotive sector, but from another angle: infotainment and autonomous driving hardware and software.

Higher spending across software, semiconductors and digital media consumer sectors will further provide a boost to the sector.</p>\n<p>Further, the tech titans have strong balance sheets, durable revenue streams and robust profit margins, making them attractive investments.

Investing $3,000 between the three should give you exposure to high growth potential, reliable dividends, and a good combination of the two.</p>\n<h2>1. Microsoft\xa0</h2>\n<p>There aren\'t many companies in the world that are as well positioned as <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<a href="/quote/nasdaq/msft/">MSFT</a> -0.79%) for sustained growth over time. Despite the company being around since 1975, Microsoft\'s growth opportunities remain high as it enters into different high-growth segments like cloud computing services.</p>\n<p>In its fiscal year 2023 (ended June 30), Microsoft made $211.9 billion in revenue, up 7% year over year. That\'s more than <strong>Salesforce</strong> and <strong>McDonald\'s</strong> total market cap. In its Q4, Microsoft\'s revenue was up 8%, but I\'m more impressed by the growth in its net income, which increased 20% year over year.</p>\n<p>Microsoft\'s increasing profitability and margins can be attributed to its growing software offerings. Physical products like PCs and phones require additional costs with each additional unit sold, but software can bring in recurring revenue via subscriptions with minimal added costs per consumer. Microsoft\'s <a href="https://www.fool.com/terms/g/gross-margin/">gross margin</a> increased 11% in Q4, led by Microsoft Cloud\'s 72% growth.</p>\n<p>Many tech companies have various revenue streams, but few are as diverse as Microsoft\'s. The company is intertwined in the fabric of the corporate world in a way that all but ensures its longevity. It\'s trading at a premium valuation, but that shouldn\'t deter long-term investors.</p>\n<h2>2. AT&amp;T</h2>\n<p>Find me someone who\'s been an <strong>AT&amp;T</strong> (<a href="/quote/nyse/t/">T</a> -1.24%) investor over the past five years or so, and I\'ll show you someone more than likely disappointed with the results. In the past five years, AT&amp;T\'s stock is down over 40%, and it\'s down close to 20% just this year.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the main selling point for AT&amp;T investors is the company\'s dividend, which is among the highest in the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong>. Its <a href="https://www.fool.com/terms/t/ttm/">trailing-12-month</a> dividend yield is just under 7.3%, and its quarterly payout is currently $0.28 per share.</p>\n<p>Dividend yield fluctuates with stock price, so there\'s no guarantee it\'ll remain that high. But I would invest $1,000 in AT&amp;T expecting to receive at least $70 annually in dividends at minimum.</p>\n<p>It\'s been rough for AT&amp;T, as the company has struggled with mishaps (like its media and entertainment ambitions) and large debt, but its current valuation gives it way more upside than downside. The company is still a cash cow, and there\'s something to be said about that. With a price-to-<a href="https://www.fool.com/terms/f/free-cash-flow/">free cash flow</a> multiple of just over 6.1, it seems like a bargain.</p>\n<p><a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/T/chart/"></a></p>\n<p', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

For many months I wrote about how the indexes were covering up the extremely poor action under the surface. Big-cap technology names such as Alphabet (<a href="/quote/GOOGL.html">GOOGL</a>) , Microsoft (<a href="/quote/MSFT.html">MSFT</a>) , Amazon (<a href="/quote/AMZN.html">AMZN</a>) and Apple (<a href="/quote/AAPL.html">AAPL</a>) continued to show good relative strength even as the indexes started to roll over.

Meta Platforms (<a href="/quote/META.html">META</a>) and Amazon were surprisingly poor and are significantly lower following their reports, but all five of the big-cap leaders are under pressure and are close to testing or breaking under their annual lows.</p> <p>Is this the final stage of the bear market?</p> <p>Every bear market is different, and this one has been unusual in how it has rolled from one sector and group to the next. It wasn\'t evident in the indexes for a very long time and the business media didn\'t even call it a bear market until earlier this year when the indexes finally dropped more than 20% and surpassed the defined threshold.</p> <p>I actively avoid making market predictions and stay focused on price action as the main clue as to where the market is heading. The thing that is most notable about the current action is that the indexes are holding up extremely well even though the big-cap technology leaders are blowing up. This is positive non-confirmation and indicates that maybe the rest of the market already has undergone a severe bear market and is now finding support</p> <p>What is particularly interesting about this action is that no one saw it coming. There have been no predictions or forecasts that big-cap technology would break down and not drag down the rest of the market.</p> <p>We will need to stay vigilant and see how this develops, but it is intriguing rotational action. We are heading into some of the strongest seasonality of the year, and there is building hope that the Fed will indicate some slight pivot in its hawkishness next week when it raises rates by an expected 75 basis points.</p> <p>The biggest obstacle that the market faces is the macroeconomic situation. Although there is hope that inflation is cooling, there are increased concerns that growth is slowing and that unemployment is about to spike up significantly.

Housing demand is influenced by interest rates, unemployment, home price inflation, income growth, the availability of easy credit, etc. The economy is predicted to grow in the next years, pre-pandemic working conditions will return, and a range of other factors will most likely contribute to the success of the housing market.</p>\n<p>Home prices are still rising year after year, though not as dramatically as they were earlier this year. The level of mortgage rates in 2023 will most likely influence how much home values fall. The real estate markets are significantly impacted by interest rates because as interest rates fall, so do mortgage payments, increasing demand for real estate and driving up prices.</p>\n<p>The housing market saw an incredible year last year, with record-low interest rates, the strongest yearly growth in single-family values and rentals, a generational low in foreclosure rates, and the highest number of home sales in 15 years. As numerous buyers battled for the winning bid, house sellers witnessed a market in which their properties sold rapidly and frequently for prices over the listing price.</p>\n<p>2022 was also predicted to be a prosperous year for the housing market but rising inflation and mortgage rates changed its outlook completely. Compared to the previous year, the housing market has significantly cooled, with home sales declining and prices rising at a moderate rate. In this blog post, we will discuss the latest housing market predictions for 2023.</p>\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a href="https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/housing-market-trends/">US Housing Market Trends in December 2022</a></strong></p>\n<p>There are still many concerns regarding the housing market. Critically, despite the fact that shortage of supply has been one of the primary drivers of home price growth, rising interest rates are deterring both potential sellers and new construction. As a result, there is no hope for an improvement in the housing supply and a sustainable housing market that would result from an increase in inventory.</p>\n<p>The large and sudden increase in mortgage rates that occurred this year rendered an already expensive housing market far less affordable. Home prices experienced a meteoric rise in the early years of the pandemic for a number of reasons, including the fact that demand was at an all-time high, supply was at an all-time low, and mortgage rates reached a number of all-time lows.</p>\n<p>The current housing market trends indicate buyers remain interested, keeping the market somewhat competitive, especially for attractive, well-priced homes. However, some factors may influence the market\'s pace or whether it favors buyers or sellers. Higher mortgage rates and recession fears have cooled housing markets from early spring highs. The market is shifting away from sellers to more balanced conditions.</p>\n<p>A little pressure on home price growth will continue through the end of the year, and housing prices will continue to rise due to a supply-demand mismatch. Many experts predicted that the pandemic would result in a housing crash comparable to the Great Depression. That, however, will not happen. Housing prices are unlikely to fall drastically, but they are expected to rise very slowly as compared to last year\'s pace.</p>\n<p>There is little consensus among economists, mortgage firms, banks, and real estate firms regarding whether the historically tight U.S. housing market will reverse course in 2023. The accounting firm KPMG LLP forecasts that the U.S. housing market would decline by as much as 20% between 2022 and 2023. Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo estimate the market will decline by 7.5% and 5.5%, respectively. Real estate companies are not optimistic.</p>\n<p>The real estate investment firm Amherst predicted a 5% fall in the market, while Redfin predicted a 4% decline. Even federal mortgage supporters Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae anticipate a 0% to 2% decline in the market. On the other side, the Mortgage Bankers Association anticipates a 0.7% increase in the housing market, while CoreLogic predicts a 4.1% increase. Realtor.com forecasts a 5.4% increase, the National Association of Realtors forecasts a 1.2% increase, and Home.LLC forecasts a 4% increase.</p>\n<p>Lawrence Yun, chief economist and senior vice president of research at the National Association of Realt', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

GDP and employment growth would accelerate as the economy got up to speed after a downturn. Eventually, as the unemployment rate moved lower and lower, wage growth and inflation would accelerate. In response, the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates higher than long-term rates, causing the yield curve to invert; the economy would slow and usually enter a recession. After things cooled off, the Fed would lower rates and the process began anew. This “business cycle” was repeated regularly every four to six years. Demand for commercial real estate has historically been closely tied to this macroeconomic cycle.</p>\n<p>This time it really is different. The economy has continued growing for more than 10 years, the longest expansion on record and nearly twice the average length seen over the prior 70 years. Furthermore, despite the unemployment rate falling to the lowest in 50 years, there are few signs of inflation. There is no historical precedent to study for clues about what might come next. What markers can we rely on as the economy and commercial real estate move into these uncharted waters?</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are still features of the overall economy and of commercial real estate markets that can help us gauge the risks of a downturn in the months and years ahead. Most of these factors have provided consistent warning signals ahead of prior downturns.</p>\n<p><em>To preview the conclusions of the analysis that follows, the outlook is positive, as a wide range of indicators from GDP, labor markets, housing markets and commercial real estate are consistent with continued economic growth and improving real estate markets and REIT earnings in 2020. </em></p>\n<h3><strong>Economic Fundamentals Remain Healthy</strong></h3>\n<h4><strong>The composition of GDP matters</strong></h4>\n<p><em>Recession risks are moderate when the more cyclical components of GDP are below their long run average. Keep an eye on business investment, construction and consumer durables in the year ahead. </em></p>\n<p>It’s not the level or growth of GDP or the age of the expansion that provide the most reliable clues about recession risks. It is the composition of GDP that matters. Consumer spending is the largest sector of the U.S. economy, accounting for about 70% of GDP but, surprisingly, does not play nearly as large a role in cyclical swings. During the Great Recession a decade ago, weakness in consumer spending was not the main cause of falling GDP. In fact, over the second half of 2008 and first half of 2009, GDP fell 3.9%, but only 1.5 percentage points of this decline were due to consumers; a plunge in investment spending by businesses and homebuilders contributed 4.5 percentage points to the overall decline.</p>\n<p>Consumers can trim spending on the margins, but cannot slash spending in many areas—food, clothing, transportation, heat and light for your home. But businesses can postpone or cancel major investment projects like constructing a new factory or office building.</p>\n<p>To gauge how vulnerable the economy is to recession risks, therefore, one should pay close attention to the more cyclical components of GDP. These include business investment in equipment and software, nonresidential structures, homebuilding, and consumer purchases of durable goods like autos, furniture, and appliances. These cyclical components comprise about one-quarter of overall GDP, but account for the lion’s share of declines in GDP during recessions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Every recession over the past 70 years occurred at a time when cyclical GDP was well above its long-run average, and during every recession except 2001, fell to below average. Growth of these cyclical components, however, has been modest over the past decade, and cyclical GDP is still below average. If recessions happen when businesses trim the fat, these days still look pretty lean. Low levels of cyclical GDP suggest that, while the economy might encounter bumps in the road, the risk of a recession caused by sharp cutbacks in business', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Here are the top takeaways from this\nyear\'s CRE brain trust:</p>\n<h3>1. TAILWINDS ARE STRONGER THAN HEADWINDS FOR CAPITAL MARKETS\nGOING INTO THE NEXT PRICING CYCLE.</h3>\n<p>According to Michael Van Konynenburg, President of Eastdil\nSecured, although capital markets have been choppy, the positives\noutweigh the negatives in today\'s environment. With increasing\nreplacement costs, growing rents, a very strong job market, strong\nbalance sheets, limited overleverage and high liquidity ($4.1\ntrillion on deposit at the Fed), commercial real estate is\nwell-positioned for strong momentum in the second half of the year.\nHe reminds us that historically, CRE performs well in a rising rate\nenvironment. But until FOMO starts to kick in, transactions will\ntend to be more "bespoke" placements.</p>\n<h3>2. RETURN TO WORK IS NOT GOING AWAY.</h3>\n<p>There are a number of unanticipated challenges impacting\ncommercial real estate firms right along with the rest of the\ncountry, including the war in Ukraine, inflation, rising rates and\nthe prospect of a recession, but the work from home syndrome is\nstill top of mind for most CEOs. As Owen D. Thomas, CEO and\nDirector of Boston Properties, points out, "It has now become\nabout balance of power – management versus labor." He\nbelieves the issue is split by industry, job function, seniority,\nand geography. For TMG Partners Chairman and CEO Michael A.\nCovarrubias, the issue is still evolving as it has moved past fear\nof the COVID-19 virus to more of a cultural change. Thomas points\nout that there is a dramatic gap in performance between East Coast\nand West Coast. New York City is doing well, but the business\ndistrict in San Francisco is suffering, with so many tech companies\nstill working from home, the drop in Asian tourism, and the\nhomeless problem. Thomas sees the primary business districts\nbecoming more mixed use. "We need to work together to\nreactivate the cities through the arts, restaurants and the\nentertainment industry," Covarrubias sees the industry\nbecoming more project specific. "There are 4 kinds of\nrecession: global, US, real estate and my building. Real estate is\na local business."</p>\n<h3>3. REIMAGINED OFFICE SPACE IS THE MAGIC SAUCE.</h3>\n<p>While the retail and residential sectors are making a strong\ncomeback, Kilroy Realty Corporation\'s CEO John Kilroy sees\ncommercial real estate developers acting more cautiously. "For\npeople to make decisions and be aggressive, they need to have\nconfidence and right now, there aren\'t a lot of places to feel\nconfident." With inflation, an inconsistent tax system and so\nmuch political rancor, there isn\'t a lot of stability to be\nfound. "Companies act like most families do," says\nKilroy. "If you\'re uncomfortable about something, you\nwait, and that\'s the pattern we\'re seeing." In this\ntype of environment, there are big buying opportunities to be\nfound, mostly for newer buildings. With the demand for activation\nand extraordinary amenities, old buildings are obsolete. By keeping\nwhat worked best in the office space, and incorporating what makes\nworking from home desirable, reimagined offices can be a wonderful\nwork environment and a wonderful people environment.</p>\n<h3>4.

Drug cartels.”</p><p>As NextSpace’s offices shut down or were sold off, WeWork opened forty new locations and announced that it had raised hundreds of millions of dollars more. It became one of the biggest property lessors in New York, London, and Washington, D.C. One fall day in 2017, as Neuner was browsing in a bookstore near NextSpace’s original location, in Santa Cruz, he passed a magazine rack and saw that <em>Forbes</em> had put Adam Neumann on its cover. The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2017/10/02/the-way-we-work/?sh=64af0ec71b18">accompanying article</a> described how Neumann had met with Masayoshi Son, one of Japan’s wealthiest men and the head of the enormous investment firm SoftBank. Son had been so impressed by a twelve-minute tour of WeWork’s headquarters that he had scribbled out a spur-of-the-moment contract to invest $4.4 billion in the company. That backing, Neumann had explained to the <em>Forbes</em> reporter, was based not on financial estimates but, rather, “on our energy and spirituality.”</p><p>The article also detailed how, a few months after Son made that commitment, Neumann travelled to Tokyo to toast the deal with him. As they celebrated, Son asked Neumann a philosophical question: “In a fight, who wins—the smart guy or the crazy guy?”</p><p>“Crazy guy,” Neumann replied.</p><p>“You are correct,” Son said. “But you,” he added, with a hint of concern, “are not crazy <em>enough</em>.”</p><p>From the start, venture capitalists have presented their profession as an elevated calling. They weren’t mere speculators—they were midwives to innovation. The first V.C. firms were designed to make money by identifying and supporting the most brilliant startup ideas, providing the funds and the strategic advice that daring entrepreneurs needed in order to prosper. For decades, such boasts were merited. Genentech, which helped invent synthetic insulin, in the nineteen-seventies, succeeded in large part because of the stewardship of the venture capitalist Tom Perkins, whose company, Kleiner Perkins, made an initial hundred-thousand-dollar investment. Perkins demanded a seat on Genentech’s board of directors, and then began spending one afternoon a week in the startup’s offices, scrutinizing spending reports and browbeating inexperienced executives. In subsequent years, Kleiner Perkins nurtured such tech startups as Amazon, Google, Sun Microsystems, and Compaq. When Perkins died, in 2016, at the age of eighty-four, an obituary in the <em>Financial Times</em> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/36493ed0-2e9c-11e6-a18d-a96ab29e3c95">remembered him</a> as “part of a new movement in finance that saw investors roll up their sleeves and play an active role in management.”</p><p>The V.C. industry has grown exponentially since Perkins’s heyday, but it has also become increasingly avaricious and cynical. It is now dominated by a few dozen firms, which, collectively, control hundreds of billions of dollars. Most professional V.C.s fit a narrow mold: according to surveys, just under half of them attended either Harvard or Stanford, and eighty per cent are male. Although V.C.s depict themselves as perpetually on the hunt for radical business ideas, they often seem to be hyping the same', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Knowing when to seek outside investment from venture capitalists can be a big decision for startups.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, too many startups don’t know enough about how the VC investor system works. Here are six\xa0things I think every startup entrepreneur should know about venture capitalists.</p>\n<h3><b>1. Understand what a VC is, and how a VC is different from an angel investor</b></h3>\n<p><br />\nIn its early days, if a startup raises any money, it’s from people who know the entrepreneurs personally. These people — friends and family — will be happy to get a return on their investment eventually. But chances are, they are not investing solely to make a profit. The money they provide is what I call “love money.”</p>\n<p>Moving up a notch, angels and VCs want a return on their investment.</p>\n<p>Angel investors — most often past entrepreneurs themselves — have an interest in a particular city or industry, and because of that, are driven to take a chance on companies “closer to home.”</p>\n<p>Individual angels will generally invest from $10,000 to $250,000, while angel syndicates have a bigger pot of money available —\xa0usually between $250,000 and $1 million.</p>\n<p>Venture capitalists are in it to make money, period. And they want that money over a certain time period — usually about seven years.</p>\n<p>Venture capital funds are larger pots of money, raised from various sources — wealthy individuals, corporations or pension funds, for example. VC funds are generally bigger than angel funds. A small VC fund might contain $50 million, a big one $1 billion.</p>\n<p>Nobody, angel or VC, is going to put a significant amount of money into your firm and walk away. In exchange for investment money, the early-stage entrepreneurs have to agree to let the new investors have a say in how the company operates. That means giving up a portion of your control and ownership.</p>\n<h3><b>2. Know how VCs make their money</b></h3>\n<p>VCs make their money by helping a young company grow and gain in value, and then cashing in a few years later when the company is sold or goes public.</p>\n<p>They expect a huge return on their investment — 2 to 10 times of what they put in, or more.</p>\n<p>Why so big a return?</p>\n<p>Because not every firm with VC money succeeds. As a matter fact, of the companies that fail, more are VC-funded than not. The investors need impressive returns from some firms to offset the inevitable losses elsewhere.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.sethlevine.com/archives/2014/08/venture-outcomes-are-even-more-skewed-than-you-think.html">It’s estimated that of all the firms VCs invest in</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>65 percent fail and return less than the capital invested</li>\n<li>25 percent barely give a return on the investment (i.e. a 1-5X)</li>\n<li>6 percent give a good return (i.e. a 5-10X)</li>\n<li>4 percent give a spectacular return (i.e. a 10X or higher)</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>It’s also important to remember that VCs don’t make their money as they go. They make it in one lump sum, years after the initial investment. This mindset affects how they view their investments.</p>\n<p>There are two', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

That is nearly 50% more than was invested in 2020, and about 20 times that in 2002.</p><p>The type of investor piling into venture activity has changed just as dramatically. It was once the preserve of niche venture-capital firms run in Silicon Valley.

Behemoth pension funds are increasingly directly investing in startups.</p><div><figure><div><p></p></div></figure><p>The flood of money from deep-pocketed investors has helped swell valuations. But it is also flowing to once-neglected corners and new opportunities.

Bartlett, Special Counsel, McCarter &amp; English, LLP</h3>\n <hr />\n <p>This post reviews basic terminology commonly used in the venture world. First, the entities into which capital sources are aggregated for purposes of making investments are usually referred to as "funds," "venture companies," or "venture <a href="/definition/partnership">partnerships</a>." They resemble <a href="/definition/mutual-fund">mutual funds</a> in a sense but are not, with rare exceptions (AR&amp;D was one), registered under the <a href="http://law2.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t13t16+816+3++%2880a-1%29%20%20AND%20%28%2815%29%20ADJ%20USC%29%3ACITE%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20">Investment Company Act of 1940</a> because they are not publicly held and do not offer to redeem their shares frequently or at all. The paradigmatic venture fund is an outgrowth of the Greylock model, a <a href="/definition/partnership">partnership</a> with a limited group of investors, or limited partners, and an even more limited group of managers who act as general partners, the managers enjoying a so-called <a href="/definition/carried-interest">carried interest</a>, entitling them to a share in the profits of the partnership in ratios disproportionate to their capital contributions. Venture funds include federally assisted Small Business Investment Companies (which can be either <a href="/definition/corporation">corporations</a> or partnerships) and, on occasion, a publicly held <a href="/definition/corporation">corporation</a> along the AR&amp;D model, styled since 1980 as "business development corporations." This post, following common usage, will refer to any managed pool of capital as a "fund" or "partnership."</p>\n<p>Once a fund makes an investment in an operating entity, the fund or group of funds doing the investing are the "investors." A company newly organized to exploit an idea is usually called a "start up," founded by an individual sometimes referred to as the "entrepreneur" or the "founder." Any newly organized company, particularly in the context of a leveraged buyout (LBO), is routinely labeled "<a href="/definition/newco">Newco</a>." The stock issued by a founder to himself (and his key associates) is usually sold for nominal consideration and those shares are labeled "founders stock." (The use of the male gender is used throughout for ease of reference only.) The founder, as he pushes his concept, attracts professional management, usually known as the "<a href="/definition/key-employees">key employees</a>." If his concept holds particular promise he may seek from others (versus providing himself) the capital required to prove that the concept works—that is, the capital invested prior to the production of a working model or prototype. This is called "seed investment" and the <a href="/definition/tranche">tranche</a> is called the "seed round." Each financing in the venture process is referred to as a "round" and given a name or number: "seed" round, "first venture" round, "second" round, "mezzanine" round, and so forth.</p>\n<p>Once the prototype has been proven in the lab, the next task ordinarily is to place it in the hands of a customer for testing—called the "beta test" (the test coming after the lab, or "alpha," test). At a beta test site(s), the machine or process will be installed free and customers will use and debug it over a period of several weeks or months. While the product is being beta tested, capital is often raised to develop and implement a sales and marketing strategy, the financing required at this stage being, as indicated above, "the first venture round."</p>\n<p>The next (and occasionally the last) round is a financing calculated to bring the company to cash <a href="/definition/break">break</a>-even.

In his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VC-American-History-Tom-Nicholas/dp/0674988000/">VC: An American History</a>, Nicholas discusses the history of VC in the United States. In an interesting comparison, Nicholas focuses on the whaling industry.</p>\n<p>â\x80\x9cNineteenth century whaling can be compared to modern venture capitalâ\x80¦ Whaling was the archetypical skewed-distribution business, sustained by highly lucrative but low-probability payoff eventsâ\x80¦ The long-tailed distribution of profits held the same allure for funders of whaling voyages as it does for a venture capital industry reliant on extreme returns from a very small subset of investments.Â\xa0 Although other industries across history, such as gold exploration and oil wildcatting, have been characterized by long-tail outcomes, no industry gets quite as close as whaling does to matching the organization and distribution of returns associated with the VC sector.â\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Like the startups of today, whaling expeditions had high costs and extraordinary risks (except being lost at sea is a rare danger for the founders of today). Yet they also had high returns if they were successful. In the following chart, Nicholas compares returns of the top 29 whaling ventures to the returns of the top 29 venture capital funds, nearly two centuries later. Thank you to <a href="https://americanbusinesshistory.org/venture-capital-a-history/">American Business History</a> for the chart.</p>\n<figure>\n \n</figure>\n<p>Nicholas doesnâ\x80\x99t just stop with whaling expeditions.

"We want to be ready when quantum advantage becomes possible on a higher level."</p><div><figure> </figure></div><p>These banks are not attempting to buy and use quantum computers directly. They are using cloud-based quantum-computing-as-a-service offerings from companies like D-Wave, IBM, Google, Amazon, Rigetti, Microsoft and QC Ware. They\'re testing the advanced computer power for complex problems like portfolio optimization and index tracking.</p><p>The banks are seeking improvements in speed, as well as greater precision in simulations and calculations for risk analysis, fraud detection and pricing of complex derivatives.</p><p>"Classical computing is reaching its problem-solving and data analytical limits," said Heather West, research manager, infrastructure systems, platforms and technologies at IDC. "As a result, the financial industry, as well as many other industries, is looking for a way to expand compute capabilities. As a result, quantum computing is seen as an industry disruptor. In the financial industry, it\'s offering a way to solve new problems, it\'s offering a way to obtain processing speeds that currently aren\'t available using classical infrastructure, including high-performance computing and supercomputers."</p><p>Using quantum computing, "financial institutions will be able to produce better, more accurate predictions and risk assessments in almost-real time," she said.\xa0</p><p>In a survey of financial institution leaders West conducted in 2021, 25% said they are currently investing in quantum computing technology and 43% said they planned to invest in 2022. The surveyed bankers are experimenting with the use of quantum computing for a wide variety of use cases that include ATM cash allocation, credit scoring, derivative pricing, fraud detection, compliance and transaction settlement.</p><p>"While today\'s quantum computing technology is nascent, it is well suited for experimenting with optimization problems, making this a prime time for financial institutions to begin experimenting and identifying use cases suitable for running on quantum computing systems," West said. Banks should also be developing the quantum algorithms and applications that will be needed to run such problems once quantum systems are scaled to a point where quantum advantage can be achieved, she said.</p><p>Quantum computing directly leverages quantum mechanics, the laws of physics that govern the smallest particles in the universe, to solve problems at high speeds. Traditional computers only allow bits of information to live in one state (0 or 1) at a time. A quantum computer uses qubits (quantum bits) that enable bits of information to be a 1, 0 or both 0 and 1 simultaneously. The result is a computation system that can manipulate and assess many combinations of information concurrently.</p><p>A quantum computer can cycle through 10 to the 154th power potential answers to a problem in microseconds.\xa0</p><p>But the technology still has challenges to overcome.

On the face of it, a limited action by one regulator against a single bank with only $2.7 billion of assets should be worth barely a passing notice. But this regulatory action is the tip of the iceberg. Intense regulatory scrutiny is coming for fintechs and the bank partners on which they rely. However, not all fintechs or their bank partners are yet truly prepared to meet this higher level of regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>Over the past 15 years, fintechs (more precisely, nonbank providers of financial services) have grown dramatically in both number and size, fed by unprecedented venture investment and, candidly, the weaknesses and lack of agility of incumbent banks. According to the consulting firm<a href="https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/journals/state-of-financial-services.html"><u> Oliver Wyman</u></a>, incumbents\' share of value in financial services collapsed from 90% in 2011 to 65% this year (even after the correction in fintech valuations). Nonbank fintechs have built large and impactful businesses. For instance, Affirm and Chime reportedly each have 13 million customers, more than U.S. Bank (No. 5 by assets), PNC (No. 6) and Truist (No. 7). PayPal alone has more than 300 million customers.</p><p>The special legal powers available only to banks mean that even the largest nonbank fintechs must rely on bank partners to deliver financial services to their many customers. Only banks can offer insured deposits, access the Federal Reserve\'s payment system and card rails, lend effectively across state borders, etc. Hence, the need for partnerships among fintechs and banks. The Durbin amendment, which severely restricts debit interchange revenue once banks top $10 billion of assets, means that smaller community banks are best suited to be partners to deposit-oriented fintechs. Large banks are also typically less inclined to jeopardize their national brand by partnering with direct-to-consumer fintechs, preferring instead to compete head-on.</p><p>In putting those fintech/community bank partnerships together, short-term incentives for fintechs and their bank partners have been in part perverse: Many fintechs were looking for the fastest and easiest "yes" from a bank partner (which almost never correlates with high-quality compliance and risk management), while some small banks sought to maximize returns by minimizing upfront investment (which could leave them without adequate risk management, staffing or technology to manage fintech partnerships). The significant time and costs inherent in setting up a fintech-bank partnership caused many fintechs — even very large ones — to rely on a single bank partner. Excessive reliance on a single partner is always a risk. When a fintech with millions of customers becomes large relative to the resources of the bank partner, the risk of reliance on a single partner is magnified.</p><p>Despite these perverse incentives, not all fintechs or bank partners have been sloppy on compliance and risk management, but many appear to have been. Not all fintechs are overly reliant on a single bank partner, but many are.

UBS and Credit Suisse, among others, were charging their wealth management customers as much as 0.6 per cent simply for the privilege of having a large balance in their accounts. But US banks too kept cutting the interest rates they paid on corporate deposits in the hope of getting customers to go elsewhere.</p><p>Money market funds and institutional cash management products, meanwhile, were paying next-to-nothing returns, and global asset managers were still having to subsidise them to keep the business going.</p><p>Now the worm has turned. Apple and Goldman Sachs are teaming up on a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f956de93-e505-4c84-a1ab-2bd23c041004">no-fee high-yield savings account</a>. Some UK banks are offering regular clients special savings accounts that pay as much as 5 per cent. UBS has finally scrapped its cash balance fees, and institutional cash managers are telling me that they are actively plying corporate treasurers with other services to make their offerings more attractive.</p><p>This, of course, is monetary policy in action. Rising interest rates and the rolling off of central bank bond buying are reviving dim memories of what it means to live without free money.</p><p>Lenders profit by charging more for loans and credit lines than they pay out to get deposits. But this “net interest” income has been squeezed by years of rock bottom rates. Now it is now shooting up as banks immediately pass on higher rates to their mortgage and corporate loan customers, but move more slowly to raise rates for savers. </p><p>Wall Street giants and scrappy fintechs alike this week have reported substantial jumps in net interest for the quarter that ended on September 30, and the main UK banks are expected to report a similar bonanza. Slow moving custodian Bank of New York Mellon was among the biggest winners, with a 44 per cent increase year on year.</p><p>Now that holding cash can be lucrative again, of course more financial institutions want it. But competition is rising within the banking industry and from brokers and asset managers which offer money market funds and other products that pay better rates.</p><p>Even though retail deposits tend to be sticky, customers read the headlines and they are starting to go in search of better deals. US retail money market funds have seen assets rise 10 per cent since the start of June to $1.55tn, although some of that is coming out of choppy equity markets, according to the Investment Company Institute.</p><p>Business customers, who have employees charged with making sure they get the best rates, are also pulling out their cash. Corporate deposits at JPMorgan, Citi and Wells Fargo have declined by nearly $120bn over the past year. But here, the money is not just shifting over to institutional money products. The ICI reports net assets have dropped slightly since June, and BlackRock, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan’s cash management units between them reported nearly $110bn in outflows in the last quarter.</p><p>Some companies are opting to buy bonds to take advantage of rising yields. But many are rethinking their approach to cash at a time when inflation has raised the cost of having it do nothing. </p><p>“During the pandemic everyone went out and raised a lot of money.

The article explored how the Internet may replace the services of a broker, whose stock in trade is information, guidance, and transaction execution, all of which could be found cheaply and simpler online. This fundamental work may be viewed as the starting point for the discussion over whether the world required a high-priced Wall Street brokerage to find purchasers for their shares when investors could possibly do it directly through the internet.</p>\n<p>True, what was once just a theory has become a reality. Exchanges are only a click away, and knowledge can be obtained in abundance in seconds through the Internet. The Internet’s utility has put significant power in the hands of people, allowing aspiring traders a chance to join the game, a chance to generate income, but also exposure to market hazards.</p>\n<p>While Wall Street was once the world stage for professional traders and brokers, the image of titans of industry ringing the opening bell on bustling trading floors is no longer relevant; now, people trade from the comfort of their own bedrooms, and the sound of opening bells has been replaced by the incessant ping of Twitter notifications alerting traders to the newest IEOs.</p>\n<p>However, another trade shift is taking place…</p>\n<p>and that is the growing, quick push toward more attractive financial prospects via:</p>\n<p>Trading in Crypto Derivatives<br />A derivative is a financial instrument whose value is determined by the values of other more fundamental underlying factors. It includes assets such as futures, forward contracts, swaps, options, and others. Futures and options, as well as perpetual contracts and swaps, are some of the most regularly traded crypto derivatives.</p>\n<p>Derivatives are critical for shifting risks in the economy and making spot markets more liquid; traditionally, crypto spot markets have been very illiquid, even when adjusted for marketcap in contrast to conventional markets. It wasn’t until the launch of cryptocurrency futures markets that spot markets experienced a substantial increase in debt and liquidity, which began to take impact between 2017 and 2019.</p>\n<p>Aside from their use as a hedging instrument – which has been transformational for venture investors looking to lock in prices for unvested/locked token holdings since around 2021 – derivatives can also be used to speculate – which is arguably their primary use case – and to get exposure to markets without having to own the underlying asset whose value you’re trading; a point of great convenience, given the nature of some crypto assets!</p>\n<p>Similarly, as blockchain technology becomes more widely used, derivatives trading in cryptocurrencies is becoming more popular. According to a research from Tokeninsight’s Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange, the cryptocurrency derivatives market’s trading volume increased by 159.4% between Q3 2019 and Q2 2020. This peaked in May 2021, shortly before China imposed a mining moratorium, which triggered the present bear market. A subsequent rally took it back to its May 2021 high, but it seems to have plateaued since then.</p>\n<p>https://www.ft.com/content/364dee59-fb51-400b-acd2-808d4ec41ab3<br />Financial Times photo</p>\n<p>What can we do to stay ahead of the game as many experts and academics forecast tremendous development in the crypto derivatives business in the future years? What can you do to go from aspirant to confident trader in the cutting-edge market of crypto derivatives? We have the ideal solution for you.</p>\n<p>The World’s Edge<br />Understanding what instruments to trade and how they operate is just as crucial as knowing where to trade them; with crypto derivatives, the underlying asset might be any cryptocurrency token, a basket of them, or even their volatility itself. Typically, crypto exchanges quote the stablecoin USDT against cryptocurrencies for derivatives such as futures, forwards, and swaps (as well as for spot trading).</p>\n<p>While this may be an appealing solution for many, those who hold cryptocurrencies like ETH and BTC, or are concerned about the peg of assets like USDT, will likely avoid such contracts unless their perceived risks can be diversified, due to the high opportunity costs associated with converting their crypto assets to stablecoins.</p>\n<p>Globe Exchange provides a solution to this by allowing traders to use virtually any asset as collateral for trading linear perpetuals on its derivative exchange, thereby eliminating the problem of orderbook fragmentation that', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Fairway’s New York City stores draw an eclectic crowd of shoppers: local residents, professors and students at schools from the City University of New York to Columbia University, and others seeking its fresh-baked breads, unusual cheeses, and wide range of international foods. Upscale and idiosyncratic, with its humble roots still evident, Fairway is emblematic of the city in which it has become a storied institution. But, fatefully, it is also emblematic of the way private-equity investors—including Fairway’s former owner Sterling Investment Partners—have hastened the fall of brick-and-mortar stores caught in the so-called retail apocalypse.</p><p>The story is a familiar one, even for shoppers hundreds of miles from the nearest Fairway. Most consumers have seen some of their favorite chains—Toys “R” Us, Shopko, Claire’s, Payless ShoeSource, Nine West, Gymboree, Staples, and A&amp;P, among many others—face financial distress and shutter some or all of their stores. Like Fairway, these businesses were owned by private equity, a form of finance in which investors buy, overhaul, and then sell companies. Also like Fairway, the other retail chains were profitable at the time they were taken over. Before those buyouts, these businesses had low debt levels and owned their real estate—a necessary precaution for companies suddenly facing more competition or industries seeing widespread changes.</p><div><p>Never miss a story.

It’s the unseen traffic director for the water flowing through our soft drink fountains, cappuccino machines, and just about anything that dispenses water with the touch of a button.</p><p>For decades, the majority of the world’s supply of solenoid valves came not from Chicago or China, but from a little factory in the northwestern corner of Illinois. Hanover, population 850, covers about a square mile, a postcard-picture town nestled among rolling hills between the nearby Upper Mississippi River and the Wisconsin border. The village is cut through by the Apple River, which is as pretty as it sounds, and a favorite of area fishermen. Hanover has produced food, fabric, and gadgets next to the river’s 11-foot rock fall since 1828, when the rushing water powered a sawmill and a gristmill. Later, in the early 20th century, the site was home to a woolen mill, where until 1949 wool from the West was brought here to be washed, carded, spun, woven, and sent to clothing manufacturers in Chicago, New York, and Boston.</p><div><figure><figcaption>Solenoid valves (Robertshaw)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Since 1965, assemblers, most of them women, have finger-tinkered together all manner of valves out of tiny components molded and fabricated in that same factory building. During the 50 years of the plant’s existence, even as it supplied most of the appliance world with these little widgets, rumors circulated that the plant was in trouble, said Bob Gable, a retired 37-year veteran manager at the plant. That, in part, was what drove the little factory to lower its defect rate to (what I’m told are) near-perfect levels, and earned it a sparkling reputation for price and quality among big appliance makers like General Electric, Whirlpool, and Maytag—something Kirk King, a former Maytag buyer, confirmed for me.</p><p>Despite the rumors, the little Illinois factory always survived, even as nearby appliance makers—appliance-making, until recently, was a predominantly Midwestern endeavor—shuttered operations, including <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/07/us/07newton.html">Maytag’s corporate demise</a> after over a century in Newton, Iowa, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-town-maytag-left-behind/">in 2007</a>.</p><div><figure><figcaption>The factory on the Apple River (Chad Broughton)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Today, however, a handful of employees are assembling Hanover’s last batch of solenoid valves at that spot next to the Apple River, while maintenance crews clean up around them and office personnel put things in order.

But none of these guys have done a deal quite like Raymond Debbane, an unknown and secretive private equity investor who is based in New York. Debbane is the man behind Weight Watchers <a href="http://www.forbes.com/international/">International</a>, which is the private equity deal of the century. This money-making extravaganza has been going on since 1999, largely unnoticed, and there is no sign that it will stop anytime soon.</p>\n<p>Debbane runs Invus Group, an investment firm headquartered in midtown Manhattan that manages money for a few wealthy European families. Thirteen years ago, Debbane had an insight about the obesity epidemic in America, figuring that people would form a life-long relationship with a top-branded weight-loss services company. When H.J. Heinz put its Weight Watchers unit on the block in 1999, Debbane got the fund Invus managed, Artal Group, to buy Weight Watchers in a $735 million leveraged buyout. Artal put down $224 million in the deal and the company financed the rest of the acquisition with debt, Securities &amp; Exchange Commission filings show. SEC filings also show that since then Artal has pocketed $3.8 billion by selling stock, unloading its ownership in WeigthWatchers.com, and collecting dividends. In addition, Artal still retains a 52% stake in Weight Watchers, worth about $1.4 billion.</p>\n<p>In other words, the $224 million Debbane invested in Weight Watchers in 1999 is now worth some $5.2 billion; most of it realized, the rest of it securing what has become a giant ATM, generating cash by delivering weight management services marketed by Jennifer Hudson, Jessica Simpson and Charles Barkley.</p>\n<p>The investment profits started flowing from Weight Watchers right away. Back in 2001, only two years after purchasing the company, Debbane organized an initial public offering for Weight Watchers in which Artal sold enough shares to recoup its initial investment and get a significant return. Since then, Debbane has been selling chunks of shares periodically. There have essentially been five big Artal stock sales through the years, including $1.3 billion of shares that were repurchased by Weight Watchers in debt-funded tender offerings. But since Weight Watchers has continued to repurchase shares from other shareholders, Debbane and Artal have managed to retain a controlling stake in the company.</p>\n<p>Part of the reason Debbane, who is Weight Watchers’ chairman, has been able to keep the deal going on so long is that Invus does not raise money in fund-structures like most private equity firms, meaning there is no investment clock and no pressure to realize investments to raise another fund. Invus does not even collect management fees that are based on the size of a fund. It can just hang on to its big winner.</p>\n<p>Who is this guy? After hounding him for months, I recently thought I was going to get the chance to meet Debbane, but on the morning I was scheduled to visit him in his Manhattan office, I was told he was backing out. “Ray Debbane is my boss, is how I look at it,” says David Kirchhoff, the chief executive of Weight Watchers, who first started working for Debbane in 2000, when he joined WeightWatchers.com after a stint at \n <a href="/companies/pepsico/">PepsiCo</a> \n . “My understanding is that he is half Lebanese, half French, he might have grown up in Lebanon, I am not sure.”\xa0 There are some weeks when Kirchhoff sees Debbane every day, grabbling lunch or just having a quick meeting, but Kirchhoff says he doesn’t know much about Debbane. “I know he has kids and one I think graduated from college, but the business is the basis of the relationship,” says Kirchhoff. “I can tell you he is a pretty competitive tennis player, there you go.”</p>\n<p>Debbane’s roots are clearly in', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Let’s take a closer look at some prominent hedge funds and the strategies they employ to navigate the ever-changing financial markets.</p><figure></figure><h2>Event-Driven Strategy: Bridgewater Associates, Tudor Investments, Caxton Associates</h2><p>Event-driven hedge funds capitalize on corporate events like mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, or restructurings. By identifying price discrepancies before and after such events, these funds seek to profit from market inefficiencies.</p><p>The key idea behind the Event-Driven strategy is to identify and exploit market inefficiencies that occur during corporate events. Hedge fund managers conducting extensive research and analysis evaluate the potential outcomes of these events and assess their impact on stock prices and the overall market. By taking strategic positions in the affected companies’ securities, they aim to capture the price discrepancies that arise due to market reactions and investor sentiment.</p><p>Event-driven hedge funds employ a range of investment techniques within this strategy, including long positions in companies expected to benefit from the event, short positions in companies expected to be negatively impacted, or a combination of both. These funds often employ fundamental analysis to assess the value and prospects of the companies involved, as well as the likelihood of successful outcomes for the events.</p><h2>Distressed Debt Strategy: Paulson &amp; Co., Elliott Investment Management L.P., Third Point LLC</h2><p>Hedge funds employing the distressed debt strategy invest in the debt of financially troubled companies. Anticipating a recovery or restructuring of the debt, these funds aim to generate returns as the company’s financial situation improves.</p><p>Hedge funds employing the Distressed Debt strategy carefully analyze the distressed companies’ financial situations, including their debt obligations, cash flow, asset values, and potential for recovery or turnaround. By identifying companies with distressed debt that is undervalued or trading at a discount, these funds aim to generate returns as the company’s financial health improves.</p><p>The key objective of the Distressed Debt strategy is to purchase distressed debt securities at a discounted price with the anticipation of a recovery in value.

While in our analysis these stocks do have an average beta a bit higher than 1 — about 1.2, judging from daily returns this year — this isn\'t high enough to account for their superior returns. In other words, so far this year heavily shorted stocks have, on average been good sources of alpha.</p>\n <div>\n <p>Take Questcor Pharmaceuticals \n <a href="/investing/stock/QCOR?mod=MW_story_quote">US:QCOR,</a>\n for instance. Short sellers had sold nearly half of the stock\'s float at the beginning of this year, placing the provider of drugs treating multiple sclerosis and other conditions near the top of "most popular shorts" lists. Yet the stock was up over 90% even before a pop in July after adjusted earnings per share came in well above consensus forecasts.</p> <p>Another example would be Supervalu \n <a href="/investing/stock/SVU?mod=MW_story_quote">US:SVU,</a>\n an owner of grocery-store chains which had been heavily shorted at the beginning of this year on the basis of its poor performance. Supervalu has beaten expectations and is now up over 180% year to date.</p> <p>Short sellers have had successes — including J.C. Penney \n <a href="/investing/stock/JCP?mod=MW_story_quote">US:JCP</a>\n \xa0, where billionaire activist investor <a href="http://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/pershing+square/13/">Bill Ackman</a> of Pershing Square has failed to turn around the company — but on average, this has been a bad year for short targets, as these stocks have tended to not only go up but to outperform the bull market.</p> <p>We can generally assume that much of the short interest in these heavily shorted stocks belongs to hedge funds using them to hedge their long portfolio. Of course, we know that some particularly high-profile hedge fund shorts have surged this year as well: Ackman\'s own short target, Herbalife \n <a href="/investing/stock/HLF?mod=MW_story_quote">HLF,\n +0.42%</a>,\n has roughly doubled.</p> <p>Billionaire David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital reiterated his recommendation of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters \n <a href="/investing/stock/GMCR?mod=MW_story_quote">US:GMCR</a>\n \xa0as a short last fall, and it\'s nearly doubled year to date as well (the stock is still down from when Einhorn initially recommended shorting).</p> <p>Of course, hedge funds don\'t only seem to have questionable performance in picking shorts. They also charge high management and performance fees, the standard being 2% of assets and 20% of profits (often, profits above a given hurdle rate). But on average, hedge funds still have positive returns year to date.</p> <p>Why is this the case? Because their long positions have done well, both due to an overall rise and the market and due to another factor — hedge funds are often very good at finding alpha in small-cap stocks.</p> <p>In fact, our research shows that the most popular small-cap stocks among hedge funds, as determined by quarterly 13F filings, earn an average excess return of 18 percentage points per year. We began trading a portfolio based on these techniques last August, and over the 11 months since inception, these stocks outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 33 percentage points.</p> <p>Note that this strategy has a significant delay included in it: 13Fs aren\'t released until several weeks after the end of the quarter (and disclose long positions as of the end of that quarter). We attribute hedge funds\' strong returns in small caps to the fact that they get to unleash their research teams on stocks which are generally underfollowed by large institutional investors and the financial media, and are therefore more likely to uncover hidden value.</p> <p>Hedge funds have some advantages for large institutional investors who are looking for investment', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

The story highlights the importance of controlling one’s emotions in trading, while being attuned to the herd mentality that often drives markets. The following two quotations reflect these twin themes of individual discipline and the pack-like movement of crowds:</p>\n<p>\n<i>“Cutting losses quickly is the foremost rule of speculating.”<br />\n“The big money is not in the buying or the selling, but in the waiting.”</i></p>\n<p>\nFor many successful speculators, “Cut your losses early; let your profits run” tops the list of advice they offer to the next generation of traders, as was the case with 12 out of the 14 renowned money men interviewed by Jack Schwager in <i>Market Wizards: Interviews With Top Traders</i> (1989).<a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-8965"><sup>2</sup></a> Here’s how one of the interviewees, Paul Tudor Jones, expressed it: <i>“If I have positions going against me, I get right out; if they are going for me, I keep them.”</i> This dictum is not lost on today’s most successful money managers, such as the Millennium, Balyasny and Exodus Point hedge fund groups, who put the tenet of cutting losses quickly at the very core of their investment and risk management policies.</p>\n<p>\nOf course, this advice is far from universally accepted, and there are many situations where there is agreement it is not the right thing to do. Many people believe the qualities of perseverance, loyalty and determination are essential ingredients of success. The well-known author and psychologist Angela Duckworth wrote a popular book dedicated to this idea, aptly titled <i>Grit.</i> In it, she writes, <i>“People who accomplished great things…often combined a passion for a single mission with an unswerving dedication to achieve that mission, whatever the obstacles and however long it might take.”</i></p>\n<p>\nIn the narrower sphere of investing, a number of financial economists – such as 2022 Nobel prize winner Phil Dybvig – have criticized the idea of a preset exit from an investment as being sub-optimal at best and indefensibly irrational at worst. His 1988 paper “Inefficient Dynamic Portfolio Strategies or How to Throw Away a Million Dollars in the Stock Market” argues that strategies that cut risk to zero following losses are strictly suboptimal if asset prices follow random walks and investors exhibit smoothly decreasing marginal utility of wealth.<a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-8965"><sup>3</sup></a></p>\n<p>\nHowever, most practitioners believe that there are times when markets don’t follow the well-behaved random walks which underlie many elegant formulas of modern finance. The rest of this note will explore two cases in the context of investing where the policy of cutting losses quickly and letting profits run (which we’ll abbreviate to CLE-LPR) can make sense. If you’re interested in the question of whether CLE-LPR makes sense in the broader context of other life decisions, read “Heads or Tails: The Impact of a Coin Toss on Major Life Decisions and Subsequent Happiness.” (Levitt, 2021), or watch Victor’s short TEDx talk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNi6KJg921w"><i>Quitting is for <s>Losers</s> Winners.</i></a> (Haghani, 2017).</p>\n<p>\nIn the chart below, we see how a CLE-LPR strategy would have fared if applied to US stock market investing over roughly the', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Can anyone invest in one or is it just for the bigshots on Wall Street?</p>\n<p>We’ll clear up all your questions below and look at the difference between hedge funds and other types of investments.</p>\n<p>A hedge fund is a type of pooled fund that uses a range of strategies to generate active returns for investors. They’re usually way more expensive when compared to other types of investment funds. And they’re usually only open to high net-worth investors.</p>\n<p>That’s why when you hear the words ‘hedge fund,’ you get a very clear picture in your mind of a guy in an expensive suit with a briefcase.\xa0</p>\n<h2>How do hedge funds work?\xa0</h2>\n<p>The way hedge funds are designed is to take advantage of identifiable market opportunities.\xa0</p>\n<p>But what does that actually mean?</p>\n<p>It can mean many things.

Hedge fund managers closely watch market data, so they can jump on investment opportunities when they arise.\xa0</p>\n<p>Those managers pick the best places to put your money, typically swaying towards riskier (but higher return) options.\xa0</p>\n<h2>Who can invest in hedge funds?</h2>\n<p>Hedge funds are a special type of investment method that has certain criteria before you can invest in one.</p>\n<p>Hedge funds will look at a range of criteria from current wealth, assets, ability to absorb any significant losses, tax status, and much more. \xa0</p>\n<p>Why so exclusive?\xa0</p>\n<p>It’s not just a secret club. Hedge funds have a much higher level of risk associated with them. As a result, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) places some strict regulations on who can invest in them.\xa0</p>\n<h3>Criteria for investors</h3>\n<p>To invest in a hedge fund as an individual investor, you will need to be accredited. This typically means you will need to have a net worth of at least $1 million — that’s not including the value of your primary residence.

Research and critical\xa0analysis are important for Robertson. Being patient, disciplined and, yet, aggressive form a rare combination. Robertson has proven he has each of those qualities.</p> <p><strong>2.\xa0“Hedge funds are the antithesis of baseball. In baseball you can hit 40 home runs on a single-A-league team and never get paid a thing. But in a hedge fund you get paid on your batting average. So you go to the worst league you can find, where there’s the least competition. You can bat 0.400 playing for the Durham Bulls, but you will not make any real money. If you play in the big leagues, even if your batting average isn’t terribly high, you still make a lot of\xa0money.”</strong></p> <p><strong>“It is\xa0</strong><strong>easier to create the batting average in a lower league rather than the major league because the pitching is not as good down there. That is consistently true; it is easier for a hedge fund to go to areas where there is less competition. For instance, we originally went into Korea well before most people had invested in Korea. We invested a lot in Japan a long time before it was really chic to get in there. One of the best ways to do well in this business is to go to areas that have been unexploited by research capability and work them for all you can.”</strong></p> <p><strong>“I suppose if I were younger, I would be investing in Afric</strong><strong>a.”\xa0</strong></p> <p>What Robertson is saying is that there is profit for an investor in going to where the competition is weak.

Even setting aside the investment potential, crypto is a new asset class and it is fascinating to observe how a new financial ecosystem of products and strategies has grown up in this Terra Nova.</p>\n\t</div>\n\t \n\t<section>\n\t<p>\n\t</p>\n\t</section>\n\t \n\t<div>\n\t<p>Biological analogies seem to be popular in the crypto space. Indeed, Cambrial is a reference to the Cambrian era, in which a small number of biological (here cryptographic) primitives came together in new ways, leading to an explosion of new lifeforms (here applications). Following the fashion and taking an ecological and Darwinian perspective to crypto markets and HF strategies yields genuinely useful insights.</p>\n<p>We shall begin our survey out in the barren lands ….</p>\n<h3>Long/short strategies have fundamental problems</h3>\n<p>Long/short equity is an archetypal hedge fund strategy where a manager holds balanced long and short positions in a company or sector, expecting only that the long positions will appreciate relative to the short ones. In the large group of fundamental long/short equity funds, those expectations are based on some form of forecast of the future financial performance of those companies, typically as net earnings. Company management may reinvest a portion of the earnings, but otherwise they flow to shareholders. Equity managers rely on this link, mostly without thinking about it, but for crypto managers, it simply does not exist. By design, the concept of profit, certainly in dollar terms, is absent so there is no profit to distribute. Bitcoin could not function without its miners but the miners are paid in BTC, not USD, a circularity that frustrates attempts to value it from the miners’ perspective.</p>\n<p>Whilst companies can exist perfectly happily without public equity, digital assets (‘tokens’) that attach to networks and protocols are, by cryptoeconomic design, essential to the functioning of those networks, and this suggests an alternative to financial fundamentals. Managers have tried to run long/short strategies based on qualities, such as technological features, network growth or developer activity. Many are intelligent and enormously knowledgeable so are likely right in their views but there is no equivalent of the quarterly earning number to prove the truth, move the market and allow them to take the profits they deserve.\xa0</p>\n<p>The crypto valuation problem is an area of active economic research and some models have been proposed such as MVPQ, stock &amp; flow and adaptations of Metcalfe’s law (NVT), but none are nearly as strong or universal as the dividend discount model is for equities. An economist may find an answer and win a Nobel prize in the process, or the problem may be solved by new forms of digital assets that capture network value in some direct way. In the meantime, fundamental long/short in crypto is a barren land where only the tough and resourceful survive.</p>\n<h3>Events are an occasional feast</h3>\n<p>In conventional markets, event driven strategies profit from the key life events of companies and their securities (issuance, M&amp;A and defaults). Digital assets also have such events but they take different forms. An example is ‘forks’ in which the software or logic of a protocol is updated to introduce new features or other desirable changes.

The effects of the bill have been far-reaching, but one key part, Section 1033, has been on hold all this time. </p><p>The provision was meant to provide marching orders to banks and fintech firms looking to share data and grow their businesses by providing new digital services to customers, like budgeting software and online bill pay. Instead, it prolonged years of squabbling and competition between banks, fintech companies, and consumer advocacy groups, which couldn’t agree on how rules stemming from Section 1033 needed to be written. At stake was control over customer data, the ability to ensure secure online transactions, and a chance to shape a new era of digital banking. </p><p>Now, finally, an end appears to be in sight. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency tasked with rulemaking under Section 1033, has signaled that the issue will go before its small business review panel before the end of the year. </p><p>An industry group called the Financial Data Exchange, or FDX, has been a key player in breaking the stalemate, generating surprising cohesion between fintechs, banks, and consumer groups on the technical tenets of what those rules should be. Though FDX doesn’t advocate for specific policy proposals, its approximately 230-organization membership — composed of banks like Citi and Wells Fargo, fintechs like Intuit and Plaid, and consumer groups like the National Consumer Law Center — has settled on a single open API standard they think should adequately address any regulatory or industry concerns. Now those members are acting in unison, pushing CFPB director Rohit Chopra to write rules that are friendly to their standard. </p><p>“Once you start getting everyone together, you realize there’s a lot of commonality,” Don Cardinal, FDX’s managing director, told Protocol. Cardinal says his sources on Capitol Hill tell him that draft rulemaking can be expected six months after panel review, and rules 90 days after that, putting the end of what would be a 13-year wait for rules governing the field of open banking sometime near August 2023. </p><p>But anyone who works in finance knows that generating alignment among banks, fintechs, and consumer advocates on regulatory policy isn’t nearly as easy as Cardinal makes it sound. </p><p>Once you start getting everyone together, you realize there’s a lot of commonality.”</p><p>Open banking got its start in the mid-\'90s in part as an unlikely collaboration among companies in bitter competition: Microsoft, Intuit (which then owned Quicken), and CheckFree. Microsoft and Intuit each had their own proprietary APIs, then open versions of their APIs, before laying down their weapons and forming a combined open API standard that is still used to this day, called OFX. The standard was formed in 1997, before “open banking” was even a term, but the premise was the same as now: creating an open-access standard to transmit bank information to financial technology companies for consumers’ use.</p><p>Banks recognized that tech companies “had an inside track with the customers,” explained Eric Dunn, CEO of Quicken and then-CTO of Intuit. “Banks were open to sharing data with Intuit and Microsoft so that customers could have a digital experience with their financial information.”</p><h3>Data fight</h3><p>By the early 2000s, however, banks and fintechs were tussling over who was in control of data transmission. Banks’ argument was that data sharing should be minimized in order to ensure financial and data privacy.

The fee bonanza caused by cheap money and giddy corporate bosses is long gone. Dealmaking revenues at the largest banks are down by almost half this year, and pipelines are nowhere near full. As revenues normalise, so do attitudes to hiring and firing. Last week Goldman Sachs, an American bank, began its annual cull of between 1% and 5% of staff, for the first time since 2019. An industry-wide hiring binge during the covid-19 pandemic means lay-offs will probably extend well beyond spring-cleaning.

Special purpose acquisition companies (<small>SPAC</small>s), blank-cheque vehicles which raise money by listing on a stockmarket, are a distant memory.

Bankers involved in the buy-out of Citrix, an American technology firm, are finding this out while offloading debt to the market at an eye-watering loss. Appetite to fund similar deals is waning.

Not only would the largest lenders survive even a savage economic downturn, but they may emerge stronger from it.</p><p>Bank chiefs talk openly about a coming crunch, but don’t seem to fear it. Citigroup’s Jane Fraser said in July that banks depend on capital, liquidity, credit quality and reserves in a recession, and that she feels “very good about all four.” JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon, has warned of an economic “hurricane”, and told clients two weeks ago that there might be a 40%-plus chance of a hard recession or even “something worse”. Yet he also boasted in July that even when Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, his firm remained profitable.</p><p>This isn’t hubris. Big lenders are better prepared for a rough ride than they were before the last big financial crisis. That’s not entirely through choice: The Federal Reserve forces banks to hold capital sufficient to absorb colossal amounts of red ink. JPMorgan, for example, must be ready for a $41 billion loss. As of 2020 lenders also have to pre-emptively take charges against today’s profit to cover future estimated bad debts. That’s something they hate but which leaves them even more thickly padded.</p><p>Dimon and his peers have also done some economic cherry-picking in recent years. Risky second-home mortgages and leveraged loans are out; so-called <a href="https://www.breakingviews.com/considered-view/where-banks-see-goldilocks-the-fed-sees-wolf/">prime customers are in</a>.

And lenders have shored up their liquidity, the lifeblood of a bank when markets seize up.

Most digital-only banks and buy-now-pay-later services have yet to experience a downturn. Many need fresh capital, which becomes harder to raise as the economic picture deteriorates.</p><p>Besides, as Dimon points out, in a recession “certain things get cheaper”.

The money isn\'t taxed while it is compounding inside the policy, nor is it taxed when it is taken out as a loan.</p><p>"Particularly people who don\'t have whole life themselves think that people enter whole life policies only thinking about the death benefit," said Wyss. "That is simply not true."</p><p>After borrowing against his life insurance for 12 years, Wyss has found much room for improvement in the process.</p><p>For both user and provider, "It\'s very painful," he said. "There is no technology and it takes a long time to get one of these lines set up." So painful, in fact, that the bank he borrowed from informed him in March 2020 that it would not be renewing his line of credit and was pulling out of the market entirely.</p><p>"They said that the origination, servicing and the collateral management is cumbersome and manual, mainly because you have to interface with whole life carriers with ancient systems, and the amount of people they had to throw at this business over time to administer it became unwieldy," said Wyss. "That was an \'aha\' moment for me."</p><p>Wyss co-founded a fintech called Inclined that helps banks participate in this form of lending. Although the asset is extremely low risk for the lender, because the cash value of the policy serves as collateral, Wyss\'s research has found that only a few banks in the country underwrite lines of credit against whole life policies. He estimates 90% of the market for these loans is conducted through the life insurance carrier.</p><p>Inclined, which announced on Friday that it had raised $15 million in its Series A funding, aims to solve this problem for banks. It already has Mechanics Bank in Walnut Creek, California, onboard, and two to four more financial institutions are expected to launch in the coming quarters. Some are attracted to the lossless characteristic of the loan, while others hope these loans will seed new customer relationships, according to the company. Wyss believes that banks are better equipped than whole life carriers to make these loans because they have a lower cost of funds than mutually organized insurance carriers.</p><p>"We are looking to partner with banks that want to make this a scalable line of business," said Amir Friedman, chief capital officer at Inclined. "These are banks that have an interest in standing up a new division of consumer lending."</p><p>The $18.6 billion-asset Mechanics Bank is both an investor in and launch partner of Inclined.</p><p>"The deeper we delved in, the more we liked it from a bank perspective," said Carl Webb, chairman of Mechanics. Beyond the low risk of losses, "It serves an underserved market in the consumer lending space. It\'s a very unique space."</p><p>Inclined\'s software will sit between whole life carriers, currently Northwestern Mutual and MassMutual, and financial institutions. Whole life advisors will invite their clients to Inclined\'s portal, where clients can apply for a loan collateralized by their whole-life policy. Inclined runs compliance and regulatory checks and ensures there is collateral to support the line of credit, while financial institutions that Inclined partners with on the other end originate the loans on their balance sheets. The financial institutions will approve the credit policy and exercise oversight of it.</p><p>"These are not loans that are originated and sold to a bank because they\'re not term loans," said Wyss.

Every time a customer deposits a check electronically, uses an app to pay for their takeout food, day trades stock using the Robin Hood app, or pays a friend back using Venmo, fintech is being used.\xa0</p>\n<p>“Fintech really is everywhere,” said Professor Robert Sarnie, Worcester Polytechnic Institute professor of practice of finance and director of the WPI FinTech Collaborative and Wall Street FinTech Project Center.</p>\n<p>According to Sarnie, fintech does not just refer to the software and devices used in this industry, but all the financial data and analysis that accompanies the numbers. Whether it is through artificial intelligence, machine learning, or innovation, fintech is always evolving and trying to streamline financial services.\xa0</p>\n<p>Sarnie believes the term “fintech” is a daunting and confusing word really detracting from the fact that fintech simply describes financial tools and payment methods used by the public everyday such as Paypal and Venmo.</p>\n<p>“It seems so hard because of all this terminology, but it is really basic business and every industry does fintech, they might not see it that way, but they do,” Sarnie said.\xa0</p>\n<p>The Polar Park baseball stadium is planning for a new marketplace in which the concessions will be handled by an AI, autonomous checkout system run by California-based tech startup, Standard Cognition. As part of WPI’s Wall Street FinTech Project Center, Sarnie’s students will be working with the company to improve their app and learn about the interdisciplinary connection that fintech has with other industries.\xa0</p>\n<h3>The evolution of fintech</h3>\n<p>According to Sarnie, examples of fintech can be found in the 1950s with the advent of Diner’s Club card, the first modern credit card. Working remotely and teleconferences are commonplace now, but according to Sarnie these methods were already being used in the finance sector for decades; he said citing his 23 years with Fidelity Investments. The financial sector was already making a transition towards remote work; however, the pandemic accelerated these changes not only for banking institutions, but for the general public as well.\xa0</p>\n<p>“The hard part of fintech is not the technology, it is the culture and the ability of the people to use the technology,” Sarnie said.\xa0</p>\n<p>Due to the pandemic, the public and small businesses were forced to quickly adopt new methods of technology. Scanning QR codes off of menus, ordering online, and using touchless payments have become familiar for most people. Sarnie believes further advancements in cybersecurity will help individuals, and businesses, feel increasingly safe using fintech.\xa0</p>\n<p>The technology is available and the public and businesses are accustomed to using fintech on an everyday basis; however, Sarnie believes that the future of fintech lies in its ability to reach diverse users.\xa0</p>\n<p>“It is about social change, financial inclusion, social inclusion, and diversity. The reason I say that is because fintech is viewed as ‘that is for the wealthy and for people who have money’”, Sarnie said.\xa0</p>\n<p>According to Sarnie, 60% of Americans do not have more than $400 in their bank accounts, meaning that they cannot pay for emergencies. Through innovations, Sarnie hopes to get fintech in everyone’s hands to help elevate saving and streamline financial services, so they are not just accessible to the wealthy.\xa0</p>\n<h3>Investing in financial technology</h3>\n<p>Bank of America has invested $10 billion in technology each year for the past decade, with $3 billion per year dedicated to new initiatives.

Unlike credit cards, the lending is typically done on a transaction-by-transaction basis, with consumers sometimes submitting a down payment to get started and staying limited by low spending caps until they prove themselves creditworthy.</p>\n<p>While they may charge fees for late payment, companies in the BNPL space make most of their money on merchant fees and advertising, not interest. Fitzgerald said the concept has become popular not just because it gives <a href="https://biztechmagazine.com/article/2022/10/money2020-new-regulations-will-empower-customers-financial-services-marketplace">more leverage to credit-averse consumers</a> but also because it delivers a superior value proposition to store brands.

The average patient cost in orthodontia, for example, can run $5,000 or more. “Most people can’t just write a check for that,” said Kensel, who used to run orthodontic practices. “They need a way to pay for it over time, so it’s a critical tool to drive treatment acceptance. I saw firsthand how patients struggled to pay for out-of-pocket expenses, and it’s heartbreaking when people can’t access credit for themselves and their children.”</p>\n<p>Fintechs in the BNPL space have a long way to go before they topple the credit card industry, but they’re not shy about comparing themselves favorably to plastic money.</p>\n<p>“The proof is in the data: 95 percent of Afterpay transactions are paid on time and 98 percent incur no late fee,” Fitzgerald said. “In fatct, over one-third of our customers make most of their payments early.”</p>\n', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

As a\nresult of the enactment of Title LVII, the Financial Data\nTransparency Act of 2022, a new framework of rules will need to be\npromulgated over the next two years that will affect the form and\ntype of data that regulated financial entities must submit to\nfederal regulators.

Crypto-specific exchanges that provide custodial services or crypto payment services are the types of centralized institutions Bitcoin was designed to circumvent, but consumers have gravitated toward this convenient on-ramp to crypto ownership.

As such, we are pleased to share the latest edition of the Retirement Legislation and Regulation Bulletin, prepared by our partners at Davis &amp; Harman LLP.</em></p><div>\n <p>On August 16, President Joe Biden signed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/text">Inflation Reduction Act</a> into law, ending months of uncertainty over whether congressional Democrats would ever reach agreement on a compromise budget reconciliation bill. The new law, which required only 50 votes (plus the vice president’s tie-breaker) to pass the Senate, provides incentives to promote energy security and address climate change, extends enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, and reduces the deficit in part by imposing a new 15% minimum tax on certain large corporations. The partisan nature of that process, however, did not impede the continuing bipartisan work on a “SECURE 2.0” retirement package. Marking another step in that effort, the Senate Finance Committee in September introduced legislative text for its version of SECURE 2.0, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4808/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22enhancing+american+retirement+now%22%2C%22enhancing%22%2C%22american%22%2C%22retirement%22%2C%22now%22%5D%7D">Enhancing American Retirement Now (EARN) Act</a> (S. 4808). The committee had previously approved a summary of the bill in June.</p>\n<p>With the mid-term elections fast approaching, any further significant developments in federal retirement policy are expected to be delayed until after the elections. The impending elections have not, however, had a significant impact at the state level, where several states have taken action in recent months to newly enact, launch, or expand a state-run, Individual Retirement Account (IRA)-based retirement program for private-sector employees. Plan sponsors should also be mindful of a new litigation strategy involving target date funds that has recently been used against several plans. These and other developments are discussed in more detail below.</p>\n<h2><strong>Legislative update</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Inflation Reduction Act. </strong>For the retirement industry, the most noteworthy aspect of the Inflation Reduction Act is that it does not include any of the retirement-related provisions that were included in Democrats’ earlier attempts at a reconciliation bill. As such, the two significant retirement provisions included in the November 2021 House-passed version of what was then the Build Back Better Act did not become law, as many last year had expected. One of those provisions would have imposed a cap of $10 million on the amount that an individual may hold in all IRAs and defined contribution plans. The other provision would have prohibited “back door” Roth IRA and Roth 401(k) conversions beginning in 2022 and would have further prohibited all Roth conversions for high-income individuals beginning in 2032. The Inflation Reduction Act does, however, include some important tax-related retirement plan exemptions, including adjustments to the new 15% corporate minimum tax on book income for defined benefit pension plans.</p>\n<p><strong>SECURE 2.0.</strong> As described in our <a href="https://franklintempletonprod.widen.net/s/ffx7lxqgl6/retrl-blt-0622"><em>Second Quarter (Q2) 2022</em> <em>Quarterly Bulletin</em></a>, Congress achieved several key milestones in the development of a SECURE 2.0 legislative package from March through June.

Federal law requires financial institutions to keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, file reports of cash transactions exceeding $10,000, identify and assess risk of customers (Know Your Customer (KYC) rules) and report suspicious activity that might suggest money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities.</p><p>While Congress has repeatedly sought to enhance the anti-money laundering (AML) laws and penalties, federal regulators have played a critical role in updating and enforcing these regulations as they apply to cryptocurrency businesses. States, meanwhile, have also inserted themselves into this regulatory mix. The overlapping jurisdictions of these government regulators coupled with differing interpretations of AML compliance have triggered confusion and criticism from the cryptocurrency industry.</p><div><h3>Latest Updates</h3><p>View 2 more stories </p></div><p>A review of recent enforcement actions, as well as regulators\' statements and formal guidance, sharpen the focus of regulatory intent in the cryptocurrency industry. In addition, the growing number of methods and technologies developed to conduct KYC and transaction monitoring help clarify and expand best practices for participants in the industry.</p><h3>I. The legal and regulatory framework of the crypto industry</h3><h3>A. FinCEN</h3><p>Planting its jurisdictional flag in crypto\'s early days, FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, U.S. Treasury) declared in 2013 that "administrators or exchangers" of virtual currency qualify as money services businesses under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and FinCEN regulations. (FinCEN defined an "exchanger" as a person or entity engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency, and an "administrator" as a person or entity engaged as a business in issuing a virtual currency and who has the authority to redeem such currency.)</p><p>Further, FinCEN requires that money services businesses register with FinCEN and develop, implement, and maintain an AML compliance program. In the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, Congress made explicit that businesses that exchange or transmit virtual currencies qualify as regulated entities.</p><p>In 2019, FinCEN issued guidance that mixer or tumbler service providers must also comply with the BSA. (A cryptocurrency mixing or tumbler service is a service offered to mix potentially identifiable or "tainted" cryptocurrency funds with others, so as to obscure the trail back to the asset\'s original source.)</p><p>In October 2020, FinCEN announced a $60 million civil money penalty against Larry Dean Harmon, the founder, administrator, and primary operator of Helix and Coin Ninja, convertible virtual currency "mixers," or "tumblers," for violations of the BSA and its implementing regulations.</p><p>FinCEN has also made clear that AML obligations extend to Decentralized Finance, commonly referred to as DeFi, a blockchain-based form of finance that does not rely on central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks. According to FinCEN, DeFi exchanges that use Peer to Peer (P2P) technology are required to comply with the BSA obligations that apply to money transmitters, including registering with FinCEN as a money service business and complying with AML requirements, including filing Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs).</p><h3>B. SEC</h3><p>SEC saber-rattling toward the crypto industry has increased dramatically during the Biden administration. Among many dramatic statements, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler warned in April 2022 that regulatory loopholes in the crypto markets could undermine 90 years of securities law. He has also likened the crypto industry to the "Wild West" and cautioned that stablecoins may facilitate those seeking to sidestep AML policy. Similarly, the SEC\'s Division of Examinations recently made clear that upcoming reviews of broker-dealers engaging in cryptocurrency sales will include a focus on AML compliance.</p><p>To date, the SEC has focused primarily on crypto as a security and therefore whether there should be compliance with the U.S. Securities Exchange Act and related laws. Indeed, the SEC has focused crypto enforcement firepower primarily in connection with allegations of unregistered sales of securities.

The expectation is that bonds will damp the price volatility of investing in equities, in effect, creating a smoother (but lower) return path for investors.</p> <p>Unfortunately, a smoother return path has not held true in recent years. The bond market has presented investors with the <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1131213/just-how-bad-was-2022s-stock-and-bond-market-performance">most difficult period</a> in arguably 100 years.</p> <h2>The 2022 Bond Market in Charts</h2> <p>With data going back to 1974, the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index had two consecutive calendar years of negative returns for the first time ever in 2021-22. Before 2021, the index had only been negative four times in 46 years.</p> <p> </p> <p>And with how bad things have been, the Aggregate Index now has an annualized return of negative 0.10% over the past five years; 2022 was the first calendar year ever to end with a negative five-year annualized return.</p> <p> </p> <p>Taxable-bond mutual funds suffered $383 billion in outflows last year. Since 1993, these funds have only seen annual outflows three times. The single-year taxable-bond outflows in 2022 more than tripled the three previous years of outflows combined.</p> <p> </p> <p>We often hear about performance-chasing, where investors pile into the asset that is going up the most. Last year’s bond market was an example of “performance un-chasing.” Many investors have capitulated on the asset class.</p> <p>It would be fair to ask, could the bond market pain have been predicted in advance?</p> <p>After all, we know bond returns are mostly a function of starting yield. Using the 10-year Treasury as an example, the yield was 0.50% in July 2020 when the bond market peaked. Effectively, there was no cushion for yields to buffer any pain from rising rates.</p> <p>One important distinction to make is that rates didn’t have to stop at zero, and nobody rings a bell at market peaks. Nearly 80% of the European bond market had negative yields in July 2020. The possibility certainly existed that the same thing could have happened in the United States. While it may seem obvious now, it wasn’t then.</p> <p>None of this is an attempt to bury the lede. Bonds have been painful and frustrating and have required a ton of patience.</p> <p>But now the market has recalibrated, and yields have reset higher. Higher yields mean higher future returns. And for the first time in a while, you can make the argument that bonds provide true competition to stocks.</p> <p>Put simply, most investment dollars go where they are treated best.</p> <p>The 10-year Treasury yield went north of 4% late last year for the first time since 2010.

Dogged inflation and a surprisingly durable economic recovery have pushed the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by more than 5 percentage points since the current hiking cycle began 18 months ago, plunging bond markets into uncharted waters.</p><figure> <p></p> </figure><p>Investors have been caught in the whipsaw. The 10-Year U.S. Treasury Bond, one of the most closely watched bond benchmarks, has seen its yield spike from 1.7% as of February 2022 to 4.1% as of August 2023—the first time it crossed 4% since the global financial crisis. (Yields rise when prices fall, so the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/xnas/ief/quote">IEF </a>lost 14.6% over that stretch.)</p><p>There are a few rules of thumb that are helpful for bond investors to take note of when navigating choppy markets like this one. One has laid dormant in the fixed-income markets for nearly 15 years: a concept known as escape velocity. This concept is a useful one but requires dusting off.</p><h2>What is Escape Velocity?</h2><p>Higher bond yields realign the risks that investors should emphasize when choosing what bonds to invest in. When yields are low, that means bond prices are not discounted very much relative to the face value of the bond (effectively the amount of the loan). With a lower price cushion, the risk of capital losses—that is, bond prices falling owing to a subsequent rise in market rates—is high. That makes a bond more attuned to shifts in the prevailing interest rate, all else equal.</p><p>Duration is a way of expressing this relationship mathematically. It has a few ingredients: the face value of the bond, the coupon rate, the prevailing market interest rate, and years to maturity. By discounting the cash flows back to today, duration gives you an approximate measure of a bond’s sensitivity to interest-rate movements, given its starting yield. A good rule is that you can expect a bond to rise or fall by its modified duration, which is denominated in years, for every 1 percentage point move up or down in interest rates. We can illustrate this concept with a hypothetical $1,000 plain-vanilla bond that matures in 10 years and pays out an annual coupon of 4%.</p><figure> <p></p> </figure><p>For most of the past 15 years, Treasury bond investors operated in an environment where yield was extremely hard to find—not too dissimilar from the first two rows in this table. As evidenced by the table, lower yields modestly extend a bond’s duration, creating a slightly bumpier ride for bond investors.</p><p>In those types of situations, it’s almost always true that a high-quality government bond’s duration is greater than yield to maturity, which means that bond investors can expect a negative nominal return as rates rise. Take the example of a bond priced at par, found in Row 2 in the table above. If rates rise after the bond is bought, the fall in price offsets the coupon and the investor loses money.</p><figure> <p></p> </figure><p>Bummer, right? But as interest rates start to creep up, that no longer has to be the case. The north and south poles of bond investing invert: Yields rise, and bond prices fall. If the conditions are just right, yields can actually overtake duration. That’s where escape velocity comes in, and stuff starts to get really weird.</p><h2>How Does It Work?</h2><p>Let’s take the example of the bond in the bottom row of the table above. If rates start at 10% instead of 4%, an investor would pay $631 upfront instead of $1,000. If rates rise by 1 percentage point, the bond’s duration of 7.2 means it will lose roughly 7.2% of its value—not fun. However, an investor still has a margin of safety: $632 is a lot cheaper than $1,000, <i>and </i>they still have the same amount of coupons coming in the door, <i>and </i>time has passed, which brings the investor a year closer to their bond maturing.</p><figure> <p', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

(175, 'Why are gold and bonds rising together? - JP Koning', 'https://www.bullionstar.com/blogs/jp-koning/why-are-gold-and-bonds-rising-together/', '<div><div>\n \n <p>In a previous post <a href="https://www.bullionstar.com/blogs/jp-koning/hyperbitcoinization/">I mentioned</a> that when I first broke into the financial industry, the owner of the brokerage where I worked was a dyed-in-the-wool gold bug. Most of his portfolio was invested in gold (he even owned a gold mine) and he was a supporter of the gold standard. When the market quietened down at the end of the day, he’d often reminisce about the 1970s, his favorite decade.</p>\n<p>According to my boss’s story, he’d spent much of the 1970s buying gold futures contracts and shorting bonds. This was a fantastically profitable set of trades to make back then. With inflation crushing bond prices, my boss’s short position was paying off. And as investors flocked to gold as a hedge, the yellow metal rose from the double digits to above $800, buoying his long position. He’d built his brokerage using the profits.</p>\n<p>This trade had been so successful that my boss kept trying to replicate it in the 1980s and 90s. Without much success. By then central bankers had pretty much tamed inflation. Starting in 1980, the gold price would stagnate for over two decades. Meanwhile, bond prices entered a permanent bull market. (See chart below). My boss’s losses mounted.</p>\n<p>When gold eventually bottomed in 2001, my boss’s gold futures contracts finally started to payoff. The 70s are back, he would cackle. But the other leg of the trade, short bonds, wasn’t working. Rather than collapsing as they had in the 1970s, bond prices held strong. When the 2008 credit crisis hit, the bond bull market returned with a vengeance as prices rose. Staring at his screen, my boss would mutter darkly to himself as each gain in gold was cancelled out by another whopping loss on his bond shorts.</p>\n<h3>That 70s show</h3>\n<p>My boss wasn’t the only one to find this pattern perplexing. Many financial professionals who had come of age in the 1970s were confused by the 2000s. This baby boomer cohort tends to rely heavily on an inflation-based mental model of financial prices. The model worked well in the 70s, and they’ve never forgotten it.</p>\n<p>It goes like this. An unexpected rise in the inflation rate pushes the price of gold higher, offering gold investors a degree of protection. But not bonds. Bond interest payments and principle are fixed. Unexpectedly high inflation means that the interest rate that is paid on existing bonds is no longer high enough to compensate investors for the risk they are taking. And so the market price of existing bonds falls. New bonds will be issued with higher interest rates attached to them in order to make up for the jump in inflation.</p>\n<p>Applying this simple model, if gold prices are observed to be rising, it’s because inflation is increasing. And if inflation is rising, bond prices should be falling. <em>The bastards shouldn’t be moving together</em>, my boss would rail at his trading screen throughout 2010 and 2011. <em>It’s only a matter of time before the bubble bursts!</em></p>\n<figure><figcaption><strong>In the 1970s, the era highlighted in grey, gold and bond prices tended to move in opposing directions. In the 2000s, they have tended to move together (pink highlighted areas), as has been the case over the last twelve months.</strong></figcaption></figure>\n<p>This year brought back memories of my boss’s vexation in the years both during and after the credit crisis. Since August 2018, the price of gold has jumped from under US$1200 to over US$1500. At the same time, global bond prices, which had been falling for several years, have been galloping higher. If he was still around, my boss would have been apoplectic.</p>\n<p>Why do bond prices and gold prices sometimes move opposite of each other (as they did in the 1970s) but at other times move together (as they are now)?</p>\n<h3>A millennial model</h3>\n<p>To see why, we need to step beyond my boss’s 1970s-era inflation model', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Year-to-date, the S&amp;P 500 is down more 1,000 points as of Dec. 22, 2022.</p><p>Here\'s why experts think this is happening and what consumers should do to weather the storm.</p><p></p><h2>Inflation and rising interest rates affect stocks and bonds</h2><p></p><p>Many factors affect stock and bond markets. Economist Anessa Custovic, chief investment officer for Cardinal Retirement Planning, suggests when we see correlations between assets — meaning when stocks, bonds, gold, real estate or other investments move in the same direction — it\'s due to related economic trends.</p><p>In this case, Custovic — based out of Chapel Hill, North Carolina — says consumers feel the pain of top-down macroeconomic forces such as a lingering pandemic, supply-chain issues and geopolitical crises. Not to mention, the United States is experiencing <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/inflation">inflation highs</a> not seen for 40 years.</p><p>The U.S. central bank, known as the Federal Reserve, wants to get inflation under control, and one of the tools they have to do that is interest rates. By raising interest rates, the Federal Reserve is making borrowing more costly, which could slow down economic growth and rein in inflation.</p><p>This may feel different and uncomfortable because it is.</p><p>"Usually, we don\'t have rate hikes while financial conditions are already tightening and uncertainty is happening," says Custovic.</p><p></p><h2>How interest rate hikes influence stock prices</h2><p></p><p>A direct side effect of raising interest rates is falling stock and bond prices.</p><p>For stocks, interest rates can affect the capital and earnings of a company in a myriad of ways, says Damian Pardo, a certified financial planner and regional director of wealth management for First Horizon Advisors in Coral Gables, Florida.</p><p>First, companies make less. In a rising interest rate environment, the cost of a company\'s debt may become more expensive, eating into earnings. And with earnings lower, their share price could fall.</p><p>Second, people have less. If consumers have less money available due to inflation, says Pardo, "earnings are probably going to get hit because [consumers] may not be buying your product the way they were buying it the year before." This could look like consumers putting off the next tire, phone, fridge or vacation purchase because each paycheck is buying less than it did before.</p><p>Third, bad news can feed off itself. As financial analysts report on decreased consumer spending and the increasing cost of capital, word spreads, stock expectations change and some people rush to sell.</p><p>"All of that puts pressure on the price of stock," says Pardo.</p><div><p>Advertisement</p><div><table><tbody><tr><th><div><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/redirect/61ed8d72-44eb-11e8-9c02-53658283ffc3?mvt=MTY4MTM4MTEyNjM2OTU4Njk5MTo4MjdjMzhkMy03OTI3LTRiMzAtOTgwMC01YmQwOTNmMzI3NTU6ODBjZmFjZTA4Njk0MTllNzFjYmY0ZTZmZWIyNjY4NDM0MTVjZjdiZTVjNDcxYTQ5OGEyZDg5OWQ5ZmRkMGM4Ng%3D%3D&amp;trk_channel=web&amp;trk_element=hyperlink&amp;trk_location=MarketplaceApplyNow&amp;trk_pagetype=&amp;trk_sectionCategory=&amp;finish_type=external_application&amp;has_prequalified=false&amp;impression_id=&amp;link_type=PRODUCT', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Investors believed the Fed was done raising rates and that the economy would have a soft landing: thus good news drove stocks higher. </p> <p>“Recall, the market got off to a great start this year largely due to views that bonds yields had peaked, especially after the March bank issues,” he says. </p> <p>Today’s scenario is a bit different. The move to 15-year highs for 10-year bond yields is not solely because of inflation concerns, but a number of reasons including the relaxing of Japan’s yield curve control that has perhaps enticed some funds home. U.S. budget deficit worries may also be a factor, alongside positive economic surprises, and hawkish Fedspeak. </p>\n <div>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n <figure>\n \n \n <p>\n </p>\n \n <figcaption>\n <h4>Stocks have dropped as the 10-year yield has climbed.</h4>\n \n Source: Piper Sandler\n \n </figcaption>\n </figure>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n </div> \n <p>So what happens next?</p> <p>Well, if bond yields can stabilize for what Kantrowitz calls good reasons, such as lower inflation, then we could see a rally in riskier assets.

(178, 'Are Your Bond Holdings Vulnerable in a Rising-Rate Environment?', 'https://www.morningstar.com/articles/715053/are-your-bond-holdings-vulnerable-in-a-rising-rate-environment', "<div><div><p><em>A version of this article was published on Sept. 17, 2015.</em></p> <p>The Federal Reserve has signaled that it's planning to raise interest rates this year in an effort to cool down inflation. Some analysts are anticipating as many as four rate increases in 2022 alone.</p> <p>Rising rates will have a ripple effect throughout the economy, as they make it more costly for companies to borrow. That has implications for stocks, of course--it hurts many types of businesses, though some, such as banks, stand to benefit.</p> <p>Rising yields also have direct implications for investors in income-producing securities, both stocks and bonds. Dividend-rich(er) stocks like utilities and real estate investment trusts often fall in periods of rising rates, as investors flee those categories when more compelling yields come on line in bonds. Ditto for bonds, whose prices often decline when yields trend up.</p> <p>It's definitely smart to think about what risks might lurk in your portfolio, particularly in segments that you expect to be drawing upon for living expenses within the next several years. And it's also true that after a few decades' worth of declining interest rates, rates have much more room to go up than they do to go down further. That could spell trouble for bond prices if rates head up. Indeed, expected Fed action is already weighing heavily on bond prices, causing losses in many high-quality bond funds.</p> <p>At the same time, it's not a good idea to dump bonds altogether. Bond prices have already fallen a good bit, reflecting the likelihood that rates could go higher in the future; it's not as though the threat of rising rates is a new concept that no bond-market participants have considered. You never want to be too reactionary.</p> <p>Moreover, shunning bonds carries risks of its own. Even high-quality stocks have a higher volatility profile than low-quality bonds. A worst-case scenario for stocks will equal much higher losses than you're apt to see in an Armageddon-type scenario in the bond market.</p> <p>It also helps to keep bond worries in perspective. Yes, rising rates tend to depress the prices of already-existing bonds on the market. But if you own individual bonds, you can simply hold them to maturity and reinvest the proceeds into bonds with higher yields attached to them. Just make sure that you're adequately diversified and that you're not sinking too large a share of your portfolio into bonds with sketchy credit qualities. And if you own a bond fund, you may see your principal value decline, but those losses will be at least partially offset by the fact that the manager can swap into higher-yielding bonds as he or she goes along. Rising yields may eventually be good for bond investors, just not right away.</p> <h2>The Stress Test</h2> <p>To help assess the impact that rising rates could have on your bond portfolio, it's a good time to stress-test your bond holdings to see exactly how much interest-rate sensitivity is lurking there.</p> <p>One common rule of thumb is that for every 1-percentage-point increase in Treasury yields, an investor could expect to lose an amount equal to the fund's duration. But Vanguard's former fixed-income head Ken Volpert once shared a useful refinement to that rule of thumb: To estimate how much an investor could lose during a 12-month period if Treasury yields increased by 1 percentage point during that same 12 months, subtract a fund's SEC yield from its current duration. That rule of thumb accounts for the fact that even though the uptick in rates leads to principal losses, the investor recoups part of that loss in the form of income during the 12-month period.</p> <p>To use a current (and widely held) example, Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF BND currently has an SEC yield of 2% and an average duration of 7.0 years. That means that if yields increased by 1 percentage point during a one-year period, one could expect the fund to lose roughly 5% during that same time frame--the 7% expected loss of principal would be slightly mitigated by the fund's 2% yield. If yields increased by 0.25% during a one-year period, the fund would stand to earn a slightly positive return during that stretch. (A 7.0-year duration multiplied by the interest-rate increase of 0.25 equals a 1.75% loss of principal over the one-year period, but the investor also earns a 2.00% yield during", datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Some readers complained that 50 indicators were too many to track, but others responded to our view that any modern economy, especially that of the United States, is too complex to understand by looking at just a few indicators, especially when major structural shifts are underway.</p>\n<p>Our notion was that investors can “beat the market” by not getting beat by it. In other words, above-average risk-adjusted returns can be yours if you simply ride the high tide with everyone else, but jump ship into safer asset classes when you see the tide turning before others do. That means, though, that investors have to pay close attention to all of the sundry warning signals that an economy in trouble cannot help but emit, though it does not always do so clearly or unequivocally.\xa0</p>\n<p>Fast or mechanical rules may deceive, because every variable must be understood in context. For a long time, for example, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Americas-Forgotten-Investor-Movement/dp/1958682306">burlap orders</a> were key because furniture manufacturers shipped their wares, which as consumer durables were highly correlated to the business cycle, covered in burlap.

More recently, <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/132494-corrugated-box-shipments-a-leading-economic-indicator-up-in-april">corrugated cardboard</a> orders serve a similar role, but you would have missed the recession of 2020 if you thought the economy was booming because Amazon et al ordered a bunch of cardboard shipping boxes as lockdowns spread across the country and globe.</p>\n<p>AIER’s Pete Earle recently gave us an <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/4th-quarter-2022-gdp-shows-growth-but-deteriorating-fundamentals/">excellent example</a> of the importance of understanding the numbers behind the numbers. Although real GDP rose 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, beating consensus expectations of 2.6-2.7 percent, most of the gain came from reduced imports, not higher exports, and increased inventories, which could just as easily indicate unsold goods piling up as it could mean businesses stocking up in anticipation of banner sales in 2023.</p>\n<p>Various organizations, including <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/aier-leading-indicators-index-remains-well-below-neutral/">AIER</a>, try to simplify economic forecasting by publishing or selling their own indices. The Conference Board, for example, revised its <a href="https://www.conference-board.org/topics/us-leading-indicators">Leading Economic Index</a> (LEI) on 1 February. A composite of 10 leading indicators, the LEI is down 3.8 percent since June 2022 and over 6 percent over the last year, clearly flashing “recession.” If you dig deeper into the numbers, though, as Earle did with GDP, perhaps the LEI should be giving even stronger indications of recession.</p>\n<p>Consider, for example, average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, which is down slightly (and', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Importance for borrowing declined over the years. </strong></h3>\n<h4>By\xa0<a href="https://wolfstreet.com/author/wolf-richter/">Wolf Richter</a>\xa0for\xa0<a href="https://wolfstreet.com/">WOLF STREET</a>.</h4>\n<p>Credit card balances include balances that accrue interest and balances that are paid in full at due date so that no interest accrues. Many Americans use credit cards purely as a payment method (and to collect the 1.5% cash-back or whatever), and not as a borrowing method. So credit card balances are much more a measure of spending, than of borrowing.</p>\n<p>Fitch estimated that the total amount paid with credit cards in the US reached $4.6 trillion in 2021. Only a tiny amount of the spending wasn’t paid off in full and added to the interest-bearing debt.</p>\n<p>In the third quarter, credit card balances rose by $38 billion from the prior quarter, to $930 billion, according to the New York Fed’s <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc">Household Debt and Credit Report</a>. This $930 billion includes transactions incurred roughly in September but paid off in full in October, that are not accruing interest.</p>\n<p>Credit card spending has been boosted by the resurgence in traveling, with credit cards being used as payment method for hotels, airline tickets, rental cars, meals, etc. Surging costs further drive up the amounts that flow through credit cards. But card holders paid off in full nearly all of the new amounts that were paid for by credit card during the quarter.</p>\n<h3><strong>Household have a lot of debt, but the problem isn’t credit cards, it’s mortgages.</strong></h3>\n<p>In a moment, we’ll look at credit card balances as percent of total consumer debt and as percent of disposable income, and we’ll look at delinquencies and third-party collections, and we’ll see that the burden of revolving-credit is now just a small fraction of what it was in prior years and decades, and that delinquencies started to tick up, but are still below pre-pandemic lows, and that third-party collections dropped to new record lows.</p>\n<p>During the pandemic, the plunge in bookings for airline tickets, hotels, entertainment and sports venues, restaurant meals etc., caused the use of credit cards as payment method to decline, and that’s where the big trough occurred; it shows the collapse in spending on services. This is now returning back to normal as spending on services is recovering.</p>\n<p>And yet, credit card balances outstanding in Q3 only grew by $43 billion, which shows the universal use of credit cards as payment method, with balances paid off in full every month, and to what small extent credit cards are used as borrowing method. And that makes sense because borrowing on a credit card can be ridiculously expensive, with rates as high as 30%, but paying with a credit card can earn you a kickback.</p>\n<p>“Other” consumer loans, such as personal loans, payday loans, and Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) loans, rose by $21 billion, to $490 billion in Q3. Most of them are interest bearing, but not all: For example, BNPL loans may be subsidized by the retailer. These loan balances are now back where they’d been in 2003, despite 19 years of population growth, income growth, and rampant inflation.</p>\n<p>What’s amazing, actually, is how <em>low</em> these balances are after 20 years of population growth, income growth, and inflation:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3><strong>Dwindling importance of credit card debt.</strong></h3>\n<p>Consumers reduced their reliance on credit card debt over the years, though credit cards have largely replaced checks and cash payments as payment methods.

It was inspired by a stint of economic-indicator-watching during Christmas week. <a href="http://curiouscapitalist.blogs.time.com/2009/12/22/third-quarter-gdp-keeps-shrinking-fourth-quarter-another-matter/">A GDP report came out</a> that revised third quarter economic growth down to a 2.2% annual pace—from the 3.8% originally reported in October. And then a bunch of lesser data releases contradicted each other and didn’t really shed much light at all. As Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics <a href="http://curiouscapitalist.blogs.time.com/2009/12/23/the-latest-economic-indicators-were-doing-better-than-5th-century-britain/">remarked in reference to an existing home sales release</a>: “this number tells us nothing at all about the future.”</p>\n<p>That got me thinking about what the most useless economic indicator might be. So I sent out an e-mail to a few numbers-watchers I know, phrasing the question slightly more politely. What was their “least favorite economic indicator?” I asked. “It’s got to be a number that comes out regularly and gets a reasonable amount of attention from the media and from markets, but that you think isn’t all that informative and/or reliable.” Here are the responses I got:</p>\n<p><strong>Mark Zandi</strong>, Moody’s Economy.com: <em>I cherish all economic indicators, although it is fair to say some indicators are more useful than others. It is also important to point out the indicators I value most vary according to where we are in the business cycle and what is driving the cycle. \xa0Having said this, the indicators that I generally pay less attention to include: FHFA house prices; weekly chain store sales; Challenger layoff announcements; and the producer price index. \xa0These indicators are either often misleading or the signal to noise ratio is very high and thus hard to interpret.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Jan Hatzius</strong>, Goldman Sachs: <em>My entry is the index of leading indicators, because it consists entirely of already-released information and the Conference Board’s forecasts, without adding new hard information. Another one is factory orders, which is largely a re-hash of the durable goods release.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Bernard Baumohl</strong>, The Economic Outlook Group (and former TIME economics correspondent): <em>I would nominate the Index of Leading Economic Indicators by the Conference Board as one that most induces narcolepsy when it is released. This measure is merely a composite of other hi-frequency indicators that have already been published weeks earlier. So there’s nothing inherently new in the LEI—and thus the least useful in my opinion.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Busch</strong>, BMO Capital Markets: <em>I would say the ABC consumer confidence. It’s a weekly number that doesn’t seem to make much impact on the markets….ever.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Harm Bandholz</strong>, UniCredit Markets and Investment Banking: <em>My least favorite economic indicator is by a wide margin the ADP employment index (hope that is prominent enough). The guys at ADP have repeatedly revised the calculation methodology so that their index has some ability to explain payroll changes ex ante. But the out of sample forecasting ability is just awful. I do not understand, why anybody should follow the index.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kurt Karl</strong>, Swiss Re:<em> The ADP report—too inaccurate and not early enough to be helpful.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Robert Barbera</strong>, ITG: <em>The consumer sentiment index. It lags changes in spending momentum. First they increase their spending. Then they read that spending is up and the economy is better.

This rise was driven by a $282 billion increase in mortgage balances, according to the latest <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/HHDC_2022Q3"><em>Quarterly Report on Household Debt &amp; Credit</em></a> from the New York Fed’s <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics">Center for Microeconomic Data</a>. Mortgages, historically the largest form of household debt, now comprise 71 percent of outstanding household debt balances, up from 69 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019. An increase in credit card balances was also a boost to the total debt balances, with credit card balances up $38 billion from the previous quarter. On a year-over-year basis, this marked a 15 percent increase, the largest in more than twenty years. Here, we take a closer look at the variation in credit card trends for different demographics of borrowers using our <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr479">Consumer Credit Panel (CCP)</a>, which is based on credit reports from Equifax.</p>\n<h4><strong>Interpreting the Increase in Credit Card Balances</strong></h4>\n<p>The first three quarters of 2022 have seen a rapid increase in credit card balances, after they contracted sharply during the early part of the COVID pandemic. The chart below depicts the year-over-year percent change in credit card balances—the 15 percent increase seen in the third quarter of 2022 towers over the last eighteen years of data. We measure balances as reported on statements from credit card accounts; these include a mix of new debts from new purchases as well as the revolving component of those balances, the carried-over debts from previous months. Hence changes in credit card balances can be interpreted to include a mix of new consumption, as well as debt repayment.</p>\n<p>We’re not able to distinguish between borrowers who repay their balances in full each month from borrowers who revolve balances over time. Thus, interpreting the change in credit card balances needs some context. A large increase in credit card balances is necessarily associated with some amount of consumption. We note that by contrast, a reduction in balances is less straightforward to interpret. A reduction in credit card balances can be caused by declining purchases on cards or a faster paydown of revolving balances.</p>\n<p>Credit Card Balances Are on the Upswing</p>\n<figure><figcaption>Source: New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel / Equifax.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Credit cards are the most prevalent type of debt in the U.S., and there are more than 500 million open accounts. There are 191 million Americans with at least one credit card account, and many have multiple accounts. Indeed, half of all Americans adults have at least two cards, and 13 percent have five or more cards. Credit cards are the most <a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2020/02/charging-into-adulthood-credit-cards-and-young-consumers/">common first credit experience for younger borrowers</a>, as about 73 percent of Americans have a credit card by age 25. Credit card use reflects constant and complex decisions by the credit card holders on consumption, saving, and borrowing: making a purchase, deciding how to pay (between multiple cards, payment options, and cash) and then finally managing their credit card balance by deciding how much of their balance to pay and carry over.</p>\n<p>To see if the aggregate patterns of credit card balances were driven by certain borrower demographics, we next turn to average credit card balances, grouped by the', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Among the many lessons 2020 and 2021 have taught portfolio managers is that investor flows often matter more than fundamentals.

Geopolitical turmoil, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a soaring US dollar, supply chain disruptions, and other factors drove inflation and reduced consumer confidence, resulting in value destruction in the hundreds of billions of dollars. The Federal Reserve was forced to raise rates, driving equity multiples materially lower. The year represented a low-water mark for IPOs over the last several decades.\xa0</p>\n<p>Yet you can count me as an optimist for the long term. Those of us who have participated in the market and advised companies for decades have seen similar cyclicality. Experience and data show that it’s a matter of when, not if, the market will rebound – and yes, we will return to a more normalized growth pattern and flow of IPOs at some point.\xa0\xa0</p>\n<p>As we turn the corner on this <i>annus horribilis</i> and look ahead to 2023, here are some thoughts to consider:\xa0</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A soft landing may be on the horizon.</strong> Unpredictable consumer behavior, inflation uncertainty, related interest rate hikes, and recession fears will likely keep the S&amp;P 500 rangebound through Q1’23. As many management teams take the opportunity to lower 2023 consensus given the tentative macro environment when they report Q4/FY’22 results, we’re likely to see a retest of the lows in the first quarter, setting the market up for a more sustained recovery beginning in Q2’23. A continuation of better-than-feared CPI prints could allow the Fed to pause or slightly lower rates by the second half of the year. And assuming no further erosion to the macro, companies should be able to post Q1’23 results ahead of likely cautious outlooks provided to start 2023. Such a scenario would equate to a “soft landing” and may even result in modest multiple expansion.\xa0</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investors and analysts are beginning to turn the page.</strong> Most pundits predict a difficult first quarter with continued layoffs, modest holiday season reports, and an unclear outlook of advertiser spend for 2023. But while attending recent banking conferences, we’ve seen an uptick in investors taking a serious, deeper look at individual companies rather than just selling off entire sectors. Moreover, several prominent equity research analysts have turned slightly more positive for the second half as many multiples have been de-risked and cost-reduction initiatives create the potential for profitability improvements later in the year. As a result, tough revenue comparisons should ease in 2H’23 and likely in 1H’24 based on cautious outlooks.\xa0</li>\n<li><strong>The IPO window could reopen as early as the second quarter.</strong> Stable to improving multiples and a steady volatility index (VIX) in the low 20s should act to reopen the IPO window as early as the back half of Q2’23 and more earnestly in the second half of the year given IPO process lead time. While the IPO/SPAC frenzy of 2021 will not be repeated, a return to a more normalized level of IPOs (and some SPACs) in 2023 could very well become a reality. 2022 IPOs were likely delayed by a year for the most profitable companies and perhaps two years for those less profitable. Companies may elect to do smaller-sized offerings depending on valuation frameworks.\xa0</li>\n<li><strong>Profitable companies will be best positioned when the window opens.</strong> Many companies were deep in the IPO process at the beginning of 2022. We could see a solid wave of new issues once the IPO window re-opens as these companies merely need to refresh/update their financials with the SEC. Profitable growth companies, those able to satisfy the “rule of 40” (or more) will likely be best positioned for the current environment. There could also be some benefit to companies IPO-ing earlier than 2H’23 as there will be less competition for deals/capital allocation than when IPO activity picks up more meaningfully.\xa0\xa0</li>\n<li><strong>Market lulls provide a great opportunity to prepare.</strong> Companies considering an IPO in the next two years must remember that starting early is key.

For example, even a 3.3% dividend—generous by today’s standards—isn’t enough to turn a $1,000,000 into an income stream that will last forever.</p>\n<p>I’ll save you the math. It’s just $33,000 per year on a million dollars.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, this same dividend yield is understated on most mainstream financial websites. In reality, this stock paid 7.7% over the past twelve months. Which means its millionaire investors actually earned $77,000 in dividend income.</p>\n<p>Yes, you read that right. There was an extra $44,000 hidden in plain sight thanks to a “special” dividend payment.</p>\n<p><strong>Three Kinds of Special Dividends</strong></p>\n<p>Most investors are familiar with “regular dividends,” which are simply recurring cash payouts doled out regularly—once or twice a year, typically quarterly, or when we’re lucky, <a href="https://contrarianoutlook.com/17-monthly-dividends-that-pay-3125-per-month/">monthly</a>.</p>\n<p>A special dividend, by comparison, is a one-time, <em>typically</em> non-recurring payout. Sometimes companies pay these in addition to their regular dividends. Sometimes, companies with no regular dividend will nonetheless throw out a special payment.</p>\n<p>Why? There are three reasons.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Dividend #1: We Had a Great Quarter (or Year)!</strong></p>\n<p>Every now and then, a company will report out-of-this-world profits, and they decide to share the excess wealth with shareholders.</p>\n<p>Such was the case with <strong>Rocket Mortgage (RKT)</strong>, which in late February announced a $1.11 per share special dividend (a 5.6% annual yield on its price at the time).</p>\n<p>It did so after a blowout Q4 report, earning $1.14 per share against estimates of 87 cents. Those profits were 350% higher year-over-year, and came on the back of a 144% jump in revenues that also easily beat expectations.</p>\n<p>OK. You and I see Street-smashing reports all the time, and rarely does a company announce a big one-time payout. Sometimes other motives can be at play—in Rocket’s case, it was facing extremely high short interest at the time. What better way to shake a few of those shorts loose than to throw cash at shareholders?</p>\n<p><strong>Special Dividend #2: We Jettisoned Part of the Company!</strong></p>\n<p>Another, more common, reason for a company to announce a special dividend is a one-time influx of cash from selling off a part of itself.</p>\n<p>Several of these deals will pop up every year. Most recently, <strong>Barrick Gold (GOLD)</strong> said it was proposing a 42-cent-per-share special dividend to shareholders, financed by the proceeds from several deals, including the late 2019 divestiture of Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines. The proposal will be voted on in May; the special dividend would represent a 2.1% annual yield, which more than doubles the 1.8% yield shareholders are getting from Barrick’s regular payout.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Dividend #3: The Regular Special Dividend</strong></p>\n<p>Remember what I said earlier about foreign companies’ dividends? They pay out dividends as their profits allow, resulting in completely unpredictable income. Here in the U.S., dividends are much more reliable, but they’re also far less flexible—so if a company’s financial situation sours, they’re forced to make a drastic cut, or even suspend the dividend outright.</p>\n<p>But a handful of stocks use special dividends to create a “', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Whether you realize it or not, dividend income has been a steady source of investment growth for generations of investors.</p>\n<p>Today, I\'d like to share you with you 10 dividend facts that I\'ve come across through my own personal research that demonstrate the power, growth potential, and also dangers associated with investing in dividend-paying stocks.</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Apple</strong>\xa0(<a href="/quote/nasdaq/aapl/">AAPL</a> -1.35%), which holds the record for the highest market valuation in history, only began paying a dividend in August of last year after a 17-year dividend hiatus, but it is expected to pay out $11.08 billion in dividends over the next four quarters -- assuming it keeps its dividend steady. To put that <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/dividends-income/2013/07/13/these-15-stocks-are-the-most-generous-dividend-pay.aspx">all-time record annual payout</a> into another perspective, Apple\'s annual payout is <em>higher</em> than the current market cap of 176 of the S&amp;P\'s 500 components. In one year, Apple will give out more cash to shareholders than <strong>Best Buy</strong>, <strong>Southwest Airlines</strong>, or <strong>Alcoa</strong>\xa0is currently worth!</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> There are few things that income-seeking investors like more than buying into companies that have paid a dividend for decades or longer. The reason is that a steady history of payouts often establishes to investors the health of a business model. Only a handful of currently traded companies have paid out dividends for longer than 100 years,and I can find no company that has paid dividends in a concurrent manner for longer than the <strong>Bank of Montreal</strong> (<a href="/quote/nyse/bmo/">BMO</a> -0.13%), which has been divvying out dividend payments since 1829!\xa0</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Sticking with the theme of longevity, dividend investors also love a company that has a history of boosting its dividend. Only a handful of companies are elite enough to join what\'s referred to as the Dividend Aristocrats club -- those companies that have raised their dividend for 25 or more consecutive years. No company, though, is more elite than ATM and security systems manufacturer <strong>Diebold</strong> (<a href="/quote/nyse/dbd/">DBD</a> -4.90%), which earlier this year <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2012/08/03/1-great-dividend-you-can-buy-right-now.aspx">increased its dividend</a> for a record 60th consecutive year.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> With interest rates at arguably the lowest levels on record, the thirst for high-yield investments has boiled over since the recession into the mortgage-REIT sector, which has thrived on low lending rates. Over the past four years, agency-only mREIT <strong>American Capital Agency</strong> (<a href="/quote/nasdaq/agnc/">AGNC</a> -3.39%) <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/04/05/1-great-dividend-you-can-buy-right-now-25.aspx">frequently yielded close to 20%</a>. But what I find truly incredible is that if you add up American Capital\'s dividend distributions over the past 20 quarters (five years), it comes out to $25.85 per share.

Understanding the dates mentioned in those press releases is essential for investors, as it will determine the timing of the distribution.</p><div><p>The four dates mentioned in a dividend press release include:</p></div><div><p>Dividend Declaration Date – This is the date on which dividends are declared by the board of directors.</p><p>Ex-Dividend Date – The Ex-dividend date is usually two days before the record date. This is the first day that the stock trades without the right to receive a dividend. On this day the price of the stock will be reduced by the amount of the dividend. The reduction comes from the price of the last trade in the previous session. If you purchase a stock on the ex-dividend date, you won’t receive a dividend until it is declared for the next time period. In order to be able to get the dividend, you will have to purchase the stock before the ex-dividend date.</p><p>Record Date - Shareholders who are not registered as of this date will not receive the dividend. Registration in most countries is essentially automatic for shares purchased before the ex-dividend date.</p><p>Payment Date – This is the date on which the dividends are deposited directly in your investment account or sent in the mail.</p></div><div><p>The most important date of all is the ex-dividend date. If you purchase a stock one day before the ex-dividend date and sell it on the ex-dividend date, you will be <a href="http://www.dividendgrowthinvestor.com/2008/12/dividend-capture-strategy-illusion-of.html">entitled to receive</a> the dividends.</p></div><div><p>Technically, some dividend investors get excited at the fact that they could own a stock for one day per quarter, and still be eligible to receive the dividend.

[+] new 2023 one</p><small>getty</small></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Now is <em>the </em>best time to roll out our favorite dividend “hack.” It’s a sneaky-smart strategy that lets us “time” the market for soaring dividend payouts (and a steady drip of price gains, too).</p>\n<p>Our plan consists of two simple steps, which we’ll look at now. Then I’ll name two stocks that are <em>perfect</em> for this strategy. Both look set to roll out big dividend hikes soon.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Buy Just as a Payout Hike Is Announced</h2>\n<p>We’ll start by “timing” our buys just as dividend hikes are announced. That’s a veteran move because a company’s stock almost always rises with its payouts—a predictable pattern I call the Dividend Magnet.</p>\n<p>And there’s often a lag between when a hike is declared and a rise in the stock. That’s our time to pounce.</p>\n<p>You can see this “set-your-watch-to-it pattern” in shares of drug distributor <strong>AmeriSource Bergen (ABC),</strong> a holding of my <a href="https://contrarianoutlook.com/recession-proof-retirement-v3/PA-CTA111522CF"><strong><em>Hidden Yields</em></strong></a><a href="https://contrarianoutlook.com/recession-proof-retirement-v3/PA-CTA111522CF"><strong> service</strong></a><strong>.</strong> ABC has delivered 62% returns since we bought in June 2020. Look at the chart below. The lag between the rise in the dividend and the share-price jump is crystal clear. That’s our window.</p>\n<p>This is Step 1 of our dividend-and-price-gain tango—buy shares of reliable dividend growers just before they announce hikes. And because management <em>loves</em> to reward investors near year-end and into the new year, we have many to pick from. We’ll look at two specific year-end dividend raisers below.</p>\n<p>We’re also nicely set up to profit as we enter three of the best months on the stock market.</p>\n<p>According to the <em>Stock Trader’s Almanac,</em> November and December are the two top months for stock performance, with average gains of 1.5% and 1.6%, respectively, during the Almanac’s study period of 1950 to 2017. January is strong, too, with a 1% gain, tying it for fourth spot.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Add a Low Payout Ratio for the Strongest Dividend (and Price) Gains</h2>\n<p>So we’ve got a predictable dividend-hike pattern <em>and</em> seasonality working for us so far. (Not to mention the fact that markets tend to soar in the 12 months after the midterms, which I outlined in a <a href="https://contrarianoutlook.com/this-64-dividend-growth-opportunity-comes-every-4-years-its-open-now/">November 8 article</a>.)</p>\n<p>Next we’re going to double our chance of big payout hikes by picking up stocks with <em>reasonable payout ratios.</em> That’s the percentage of free cash flow (FCF)—the best snapshot of the cash a company is generating—that’s devoted to dividends. When it comes to dividend safety, I demand a ratio below 50%. The lower, the better.</p>\n<p>Now let’s dive into two names that tick our boxes, with a strong chance of announcing big dividend hikes in the next few months, plus the financial strength to double (or more!) their payouts in short', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Let\'s look at the situation in greater detail, shall we?\n</p><p>First of all, what is a "Dividend Run" anyway? This is an interesting concept which we first learned about at a past ValueForum conference. And to best explain the concept, we need to start with the expected behavior of a stock on its <i>ex-dividend</i> date.</p>\n<p>For anyone unfamiliar with the term, the <i>ex-dividend date</i> marks the trading day when any buyer of the stock is no longer entitled to the referenced dividend — in other words, to be eligible to receive the dividend in question, one would have had to purchase their shares <i>before</i> the ex-dividend date.</p>\n<p>All else equal, the stock price would be expected to <i>drop by the dividend amount</i> on that <i>ex-</i>date (remember, that\'s "all else equal" and naturally other factors will drive stocks higher/lower on any given day). But think about it: if a buyer is entitled to a 0.03 dividend <i>before</i> ex-date, but no longer entitled to that amount <i>on or after</i> ex-date, then this drop makes perfect sense! Because if the shares <i>didn\'t</i> drop by that same 0.03 the next day, then <i>effectively</i>, buyers would effectively be paying 0.03 <i>more</i> for the same share of stock.</p>\n<p>But now think about <i>this:</i> if a stock is expected to <i>drop</i> by the dividend amount (all else equal) <i>on</i> ex-date, then in turn, shouldn\'t that stock be expected to <i>rise</i> sometime <i>ahead</i> of a dividend? After all, if a dividend-paying stock didn\'t ever rise and only fell on each and every ex-date, then eventually after enough dividend payments those shares would have fallen to zero. And <i>that</i> wouldn\'t make <i>any</i> sense for a company continually earning money and paying dividends. So indeed, "sometime" <i>before</i> a given dividend, there should be sort of a built-in "pressure" for a stock to gradually rise in expectation of that next cash dividend... in other words: pressure for the stock to have a potential <i>Dividend Run</i>.</p>\n<p>And notice we put the word "sometime" in quotes in that last sentence, because there are differing views among different dividend investors about <i>timeframe</i> when it comes to capturing Dividend Run effects. Some like to invest (and then also to sell) on specific target dates; others like to employ some form of dollar cost averaging. Some like to invest shortly before ex-div, hold for the dividend, and then sell on or after ex-date (having actually capturing the dividend / received the income). Others like to sell the day <i>before</i> ex-date (the last possible day where the buyer of the shares will still be "paying for" the upcoming dividend) with the idea to try and maximize <i>capital gain</i>. In this capital-gain-focused scenario, one common timeframe we\'ve seen discussed, is to buy about two weeks (ten trading days) prior to the targeted sale date.</p>\n<p>For example, consider the 0.03/share BKTI dividend that went "ex-dividend" on 04/29/22. On the prior trading day — the last day where a seller knows that the buyer of their shares will be expecting that dividend amount — shares of BKTI closed at 2.35.

But if you apply it to the payment of dividends, the standard American approach is to cut the pie in four equal pieces. The vast majority of U.S. dividend-payers distribute quarterly dividends of an equal amount until they set a new--preferably higher--dividend rate.</p> <p>Yet there’s no regulatory requirement that U.S. companies pay a fixed quarterly dividend, and there are plenty of exceptions to this standard, including multiple monthly dividend-payers in the REIT space. Realty Income (<a href="/stocks/xnys/o/quote">O</a>) has even trademarked “The Monthly Dividend Company” as a marketing slogan. On the other end of the spectrum, some U.S. companies pay a single annual dividend. Walt Disney (<a href="/stocks/xnys/dis/quote">DIS</a>) suspended its dividend at the beginning of the pandemic and has yet to resume it, but the company paid an annual dividend for years before switching to semiannual payouts in 2015.</p> <p>Some companies outside the United States, like British American Tobacco (<a href="/stocks/xnys/bti/quote">BTI</a>) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (<a href="/stocks/xnys/tsm/quote">TSM</a>), pay a fixed quarterly dividend, but annual and semiannual dividend payments are also common, with many companies paying an interim dividend followed by a final payout for the year, based on full-year earnings. There are some merits and downsides to both of these methods. The four-equal-payments approach provides income-focused investors with a fairly high degree of certainty. Barring a dividend cut or suspension, investors know exactly how much they’re set to receive each quarter from the shares they own. And when evaluating potential investments, they can make apples to-apples comparisons of the current forward yields of different dividend-paying stocks.</p> <p>One criticism of equal quarterly dividends appeared in a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-many-people-misunderstand-dividends-and-the-damage-this-does-11591454292">June 2020 article in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>.\xa0London Business School professor of finance Alex Edmans wrote that fixed quarterly dividend payments harm the companies that pay them (and therefore the investors who purchase the shares) because it encourages them to make what he believes could be unwise capital allocation decisions. He argued that quarterly payments of a fixed amount are inflexible and that companies--fearful of the stock price decline that generally accompanies any dividend cut--too often continue to pay their dividends when they can’t afford them, or at the expense of better uses of those dollars. </p> <p>Edmans made the case for buybacks and special one-off dividends as superior ways to return cash to shareholders, because investors don’t have the same expectation that they will continue, as they do with quarterly dividends. Hence, there’s no negative reaction when the same buyback or special dividend doesn’t occur in the subsequent year. There’s another argument--one that Edmans didn’t mention--that can be made against fixed quarterly dividends: Earnings and cash flow aren’t guaranteed, and some dividend-paying companies, especially those in industries that typically see a great deal of variation in cash flow from year to year or quarter to quarter, could be reluctant to devote too much cash to the dividend. They may take an overly conservative approach, keeping the dividend low enough to avoid future dividend cuts and the subsequent punishment of the share price by the market.</p> <h2>A Hybrid Approach: Variable Dividends</h2> <p>Over the past six months, a number of energy companies, all in the energy exploration and production industry, have introduced variable dividend plans, as detailed in the table below. In most cases, this involves a fixed quarterly dividend amount with a variable component that’s based on a set percentage of the previous quarter’s cash flow, minus the fixed amount.</p> <p> </p> <p>Why is this taking place in the E&amp;P industry?

For example, even a 3.3% dividend—generous by today’s standards—isn’t enough to turn a $1,000,000 into an income stream that will last forever.</p>\n<p>I’ll save you the math. It’s just $33,000 per year on a million dollars.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, this same dividend yield is understated on most mainstream financial websites. In reality, this stock paid 7.7% over the past twelve months. Which means its millionaire investors actually earned $77,000 in dividend income.</p>\n<p>Yes, you read that right. There was an extra $44,000 hidden in plain sight thanks to a “special” dividend payment.</p>\n<p><b>Three Kinds of Special Dividends</b></p>\n<p>Most investors are familiar with “regular dividends,” which are simply recurring cash payouts doled out regularly—once or twice a year, typically quarterly, or when we’re lucky, <a href="https://contrarianoutlook.com/17-monthly-dividends-that-pay-3125-per-month/">monthly</a>.</p>\n<p>A special dividend, by comparison, is a one-time, <i>typically</i> non-recurring payout. Sometimes companies pay these in addition to their regular dividends. Sometimes, companies with no regular dividend will nonetheless throw out a special payment.</p>\n<p>Why? There are three reasons.</p>\n<p><b>Special Dividend #1: We Had a Great Quarter (or Year)!</b></p>\n<p>Every now and then, a company will report out-of-this-world profits, and they decide to share the excess wealth with shareholders.</p>\n<p>Such was the case with <b>Rocket Mortgage (RKT)</b>, which in late February announced a $1.11 per share special dividend (a 5.6% annual yield on its price at the time).</p>\n<p>It did so after a blowout Q4 report, earning $1.14 per share against estimates of 87 cents. Those profits were 350% higher year-over-year, and came on the back of a 144% jump in revenues that also easily beat expectations.</p>\n<p>OK. You and I see Street-smashing reports all the time, and rarely does a company announce a big one-time payout. Sometimes other motives can be at play—in Rocket’s case, it was facing extremely high short interest at the time. What better way to shake a few of those shorts loose than to throw cash at shareholders?</p>\n<p><b>Of Course, It Didn’t Last Forever</b><br />\n</p>\n<p><b>Special Dividend #2: We Jettisoned Part of the Company!</b></p>\n<p>Another, more common, reason for a company to announce a special dividend is a one-time influx of cash from selling off a part of itself.</p>\n<p>Several of these deals will pop up every year. Most recently, <b>Barrick Gold (GOLD)</b> said it was proposing a 42-cent-per-share special dividend to shareholders, financed by the proceeds from several deals, including the late 2019 divestiture of Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines. The proposal will be voted on in May; the special dividend would represent a 2.1% annual yield, which more than doubles the 1.8% yield shareholders are getting from Barrick’s regular payout.</p>\n<p><b>Special Dividend #3: The Regular Special Dividend</b></p>\n<p>Remember what I said earlier about foreign companies’ dividends? They pay out dividends as their profits allow, resulting in completely unpredictable income. Here in the U.S., dividends are much more reliable, but they’re also far less flexible—so if a company’s financial situation sours, they’re forced to make a drastic cut, or even suspend the dividend outright.</p>\n<p>But a handful of stocks use special dividends to create a “hybrid” dividend program—one where they offer a', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

But the pandemic ushered in shutdowns and unemployment during 2021. However, the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">Bureau of Labor Statistics </a>reported that unemployment was only 4.2% at the end of November 2021. This marks an improvement over November 2020, when the rate was 6.7%. </p><p>We\'re still contending with inflation, and I don\'t think it\'s going away anytime soon.

And some cardholders have reported getting credit limit increases without even asking, which sounds awfully nice of issuers. But before you send a thank-you note to your credit card company, be aware that the motives of the card companies aren\'t exactly altruistic. </p><p>They see consumers venturing into stores and spending again, and they want your business. Every time you make a purchase, the credit company gets a transaction fee. Plus, if you carry a balance, they get to charge you interest.</p><p>In 2020, due to the pandemic, credit was tight, which means it was difficult to get approved for a credit card or to get a credit limit increase. For those who have subprime credit, it was difficult to get through the pandemic without access to credit. <br /></p><p>But according to a <a href="https://newsroom.transunion.com/transunion-forecasts-originations-to-non-prime-borrowers--will-continue-to-rise-for-many-credit-products-in-2022/">2022 forecast</a> from TransUnion, the market for the subprime population will open up again in 2022. During the height of the pandemic, credit card issuers were having financial issues and weren\'t willing to take on risky customers.</p><p>Even though credit will loosen, maintaining a high credit score will still be essential. <a href="https://money.usnews.com/credit-cards/best-new-credit-cards">A new credit card</a> or a <a href="https://money.usnews.com/credit-cards/high-credit-limits">higher limit</a> gives you more available credit.

That’s up from 50% a year ago. Forty percent said they’ve been in credit card debt for over two years. A quarter of those surveyed said that the reason they carry outstanding credit card debt is to cover daily expenses. The Fed’s July consumer credit report (it has a two-month lag) showed that credit card debt hit a record $4.64 trillion. It’s likely that credit card defaults are going to start shooting higher, causing increased stress on bank balance sheets and credit markets.</p>\n<p>A couple weeks ago Goldman Sachs reported that the losses (bad debt write-offs) on its credit card business hit 2.93% in Q2. That’s the largest loss-rate among big credit card issuers (Goldman in recent years has made a big push into retail banking services). As it turns out, more that 25% of Goldman’s credit card loans have gone to people with sub-660 FICO scores.</p>\n<p>See a trend here?:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The chart above plots consumer credit card debt balances (blue line, left y-axis) vs the personal savings rate (red line, right y-axis). Credit card debt outstanding is at an all-time high, while the personal savings rate is at its lowest level since the great financial crisis. Keep in mind, though, that a significantly higher percentage of personal savings is with the upper 5% wealth/income demographic relative to the 2008/9 period. Also, the savings rate just after the virus lockdown was a product of the Government handouts in the form stimulus checks and PPP loans. The PPP loans were forgiven. The funds from those programs are now spent. Keep in mind that the savings rate metric is deceptive. The majority of the savings in the U.S. is attributable to the upper 5% income/wealth demographic – and really the upper 1%. How do we know? Because a Lending Club survey a few months ago showed that 23% of those making $250k or more were living paycheck to paycheck; no savings but they live in a fancy house and sport $100k SUVs and sedans in the driveway.</p>\n<p>What stands out most to me in the chart above is that credit card debt levels explode relative to the savings rate when the financial markets and economy are entering a period of turmoil. I took the chart back to 2003. The same pattern occurred in 1998/1999 right before the tech bubble collapsed, but it’s not as pronounced because the money supply and outstanding household debt was diminutive relative to the post-tech stock crash period, when Greenspan juiced the money supply and encouraged all flavors of consumer borrowing.</p>\n<p>Of course, over the next several months, escalating consumer debt losses will not be unique to Goldman. For point of reference, the overall credit card delinquency rate hit 2.7% in Q1 2020. At the peak in the financial crisis years, the delinquency/charge-off rate, according to Fed statistics, hit a peak of 6.77% outstanding balances in Q2 2009. I believe there’s a good chance it will be much worse this time around.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the delinquency and default problem will not be confined to credit cards. Over the last few years, particularly since April 2020, households have stretched beyond rational limits and to assume auto loans and mortgages that many can barely afford and soon will no longer be able to afford. While Carmax’s big earnings miss and subsequent 25% drop in its stock grabbed the headlines on Friday, buried in its Q3 report was an increase in bad debt charge offs and an increase in the provision for credit losses. Carmax is not unique in this regard.</p>\n<p>Brace yourself for the impact of a credit crisis that will be be far worse than the one that hit in 2008 – perhaps this is why gold and silver have begun to outperform the stock market.</p>\n\t</div></div>', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

But what has caused much of the volatility in asset\n prices has been investors’ fickle expectations regarding these trends. Consider the market rally that began in mid-June. The primary cause was a significant drop in Treasury yields that, counterintuitively, began after the Federal Reserve hiked\n the fed funds rate by 75 basis points, reiterating its commitment to fighting inflation. Investors appeared to believe that the Fed’s actions would slow the economy enough to tame inflation, but not enough to cause a significant recession or\n meaningfully reduce corporate earnings. By the end of July, the futures market had lowered the anticipated peak fed funds rate by approximately 50 bps and begun to price in a drop in short-term interest rates beginning in early 2023. (See Figure 1.)\n But by the time the Fed met in September, investors had already changed their minds: The expected terminal rate had climbed by more than 100 bps, and the anticipated start of the rate-cutting cycle had been pushed into late 2023.</p><p>What brought about this U-turn? In the weeks surrounding the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium in late August, Fed Chair Jay Powell and other officials reiterated the central bank’s commitment to fighting inflation. In other words, very little\n about the macroeconomic environment had actually changed, but investors’ interpretations of it had changed dramatically, as had asset prices.</p><p>Since the end of the quarter, we’ve continued to see significant moves in financial markets, often based on modest changes in economic data and massive swings in investor sentiment. We’ve also seen unexpected crises emerge. (For instance,\n in August, how many investors had “turmoil in the UK gilt market” designated as a key risk?) As Howard Marks recently wrote in his memo <a href="/insights/memo/the-illusion-of-knowledge">The Illusion of Knowledge</a>,\n few, if any, investors have the ability to consistently and profitably predict macroeconomic trends. But investors’ attempts to do just that are currently driving markets, which means we should expect many twists and turns in the road ahead.\n <strong>Value-focused investors may thrive in this environment, but only if they have the capital and conviction needed to withstand the volatility as well as the ability to find signals – and invest wisely – despite all the macro noise.</strong>\n</p><p><em>Figure 1: Interest Rate Expectations Have Shifted Dramatically in Recent Months</em>\n</p><p></p><p><em>Source: Bloomberg</em>\n </p><p>Signal #1: “Junk Loans” are raising alarm bells</p><p>Rising interest rates have dominated the credit market story in 2022.

Over the last thirty-five years, non-mortgage consumer debt has been an increasing factor, as has the general drift from manufacturing to the provision of services. To whom the banks owe deposit money has changed from almost entirely consumers with savings and small businesses’ cash balances to a greater proportion of purely financial businesses. </p><p>The absence, so far, of price inflation to match the expansion of US bank credit since the last credit crisis is in large measure explained by the ownership of cash. Of the institutions and businesses, we know from figures released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that of the $12.8 trillion of cash, deposits and checking accounts in the banking system, foreigners (overwhelmingly financial institutions) have cash deposits of $4.217 trillion.<sup>[i]</sup></p><p>This is hot money, created by bank credit, but not spent and therefore not driving up consumer prices. This is an example of why the evolution of bank customers on the liabilities side of the banks’ balance sheets affect how the credit cycle should be read, the likely duration of the final pre-crisis phase estimated, and how the crisis itself will unfold. Furthermore, having created the credit cycle through its suppression of interest rates, the Fed lacks the theoretical knowledge to understand the extent of the problem it has both created and oversees.</p><p>This article examines these dynamics and concludes that the duration of this final phase of the credit cycle may be considerably shorter than most people expect, and is likely to be driven more by financial than economic considerations.</p></div>\n<h2>Interest rates do not control credit demand</h2>\n<div><p>We start by looking at why central banks cannot control inflation by managing interest rates. Last week, the Bank of England raised its base lending rate by a quarter of a per cent to three-quarters of a per cent. In its statement, the Bank stated that its “Monetary Policy Committee sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target and in a way that helps sustain growth and unemployment.” In this, the Bank’s monetary policy is little different from the other major central banks, particularly that of the American Fed.</p><p>There are multiple links in the supposed chain between changes in interest rates and the 2% inflation target, but essentially the Bank must be assuming that an interest rate is the price of borrowing money. If that was so, you would expect higher interest rates to reduce the growth of bank credit, and lower rates to stimulate it, and if you control the rate of monetary growth, then the quantity theory of money suggests you can influence the rate of price inflation. This is a common assumption in financial markets, which are necessarily in tune with central banks’ monetary policy.</p><p>The facts suggest otherwise. The following chart shows what happened in the US between 1970 and 1990, including the time when Paul Volcker, as Chairman of the Fed, jacked up the prime rate to 20% in the early 1980s. The reason for illustrating these decades is that volatility in interest rates were at their most violent, and the effects should be at their most obvious.</p></div>\n<p></p>\n<p>If interest rates were money’s “price”, one would expect to see higher rates at least slow down monetary growth, and even make it contract. Lower rates should make money supply growth accelerate. This plainly did not happen, and it has never happened since money became totally fiat. Nor did it happen in the days before money’s purchasing power sank year after year, when Gibson’s paradox clearly showed there was no correlation between interest rates and price inflation. This being the case, it is evident that the supposed link between interest rates and bank lending as a means of controlling price inflation has never existed.<sup>[ii]</sup></p><p>Gibson’s paradox, whereby interest rates correlated with the general price level and not the rate of price inflation, appears to have altered since the 1970s, because the general price level has simply soared. Measured in gold, the dollar has lost 96.5% of its purchasing power since it was last officially set at $42.22 per ounce. Obviously, a collapse in the purchasing power of money is bound to undermine long-established relationships between the general level of prices and interest rates.

Just look at the rising numbers of day traders, the wild ride of cryptocurrencies or the new issuance boom by special purpose acquisition companies and all manner of loss-making companies. By most established investment metrics, the S&amp;P 500 Index is close to an all-time peak. Yet valuation measures don’t predict how long irrational exuberance might last. The credit cycle, however, provides more useful information about market timing. In the United States, credit indicators are flashing somewhere between amber and red.</p><p>The notion of the credit cycle goes back at least to the mid-19th century. Victorian banker Lord Overstone described its latter stages as consisting of “excitement, – over-trading, – convulsion, – pressure, – stagnation, [and] – distress.” Given the financial nature of the modern economy, this appears even more relevant today. The Bank for International Settlements has developed a model which it claims helps to predict financial crises and economic downturns. From an investment perspective, peaks in the credit cycle are normally followed by severe bear markets.</p><p>The BIS model measures the extent to which private-sector credit and home prices have departed from trend. By this yardstick, the U.S. financial cycle looks to have entered dangerous territory. In May the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index hit a record high, up 16.6% over the year. The last time house prices rose this rapidly was in the late stages of the real estate bubble that burst in 2008. Nonfinancial credit in the United States has also been expanding at a blistering pace. Last year, household and corporate debt climbed by 13.7 percentage points relative to GDP, the BIS says.</p><div><h3>Latest Updates</h3><p>View 2 more stories </p></div><p>Lending standards become progressively looser over the course of a booming credit cycle. In 2019, around one-quarter of corporate bonds issued in the developed world failed to earn an investment-grade rating, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Since then, credit quality has continued to deteriorate. In the first quarter, a record amount of junk debt was sold in the United States. High-yield bonds have accounted for 27% of total American bond issuance this year – the highest level in a decade, according to S&amp;P’s Leveraged Commentary &amp; Data. Spreads on junk bonds have also tightened, falling to a 10-year low in early July.</p><p>It’s not just fixed-income investors that have relaxed their guard. The Federal Reserve’s survey of senior loan officers reveals that banks have pivoted from extreme caution last year to relative abandon today.</p><p>Inflation surprises generally occur towards the end of the cycle when the economy is running out of slack. U.S. inflation numbers are noisy and heavily influenced by transitory measures, such as the recent surge in secondhand car prices. The BIS observes that inflation hasn’t been the main driver of the business cycle since the Fed under the late Paul Volcker tamed inflation nearly 40 years ago. Nevertheless, the fact that American consumer prices have been rising at a faster pace than at any time since the 2008 financial crisis is another worrying signal.</p><p>Not all financial indicators are flashing red, however. During credit booms, households and corporations tend to spend more than they earn. The British economist Wynne Godley was able to accurately predict economic downturns by looking at the extent to which households and businesses were running financial deficits. At such moments, the risk of a credit crunch, accompanied by severe economic disruption, becomes elevated. Prior to the 2008 subprime crisis, the private-sector financial balance was negative in several countries, including the United States. Today, by contrast, American households and corporations are flush with cash – thanks in large measure to Washington’s enormous fiscal deficits.</p><p>The spread between short- and long-term rates is another common input into credit cycle models. Past U.S. recessions have often been preceded by an inversion of the yield curve when monetary tightening causes short-term interest rates to rise above the yield on 10-year bonds. In early 2006, for instance, the U.S. yield curve inverted just as problems with subprime securities were emerging. The yield curve flattened again in 2018 after the Fed', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Both of those asset types may be redeployed; however, missing and scrapped assets can only be written off.</p><div>\n<p>Article Figures</p>\n<p><a href="/ext/resources/images/issues/2019/03/figures/20191023assets_ex3.jpg"></a>\n<br />\n<b>[Figure 3] A FAR enhanced with additional engineering details</b> <a href="/ext/resources/images/issues/2019/03/figures/20191023assets_ex3.jpg">Enlarge this image</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>There are a number of root causes for unused-asset generation. Some of them are addressable and some are not, which means they must be accepted as a cost of doing business. Figure 1 provides some common examples of unused assets, their root causes, and whether or not they can be remedied.</p>\n<p>In my experience, almost 90 percent of unused assets arise due to predetermined actions, such as changes in manufacturing footprint, capacity expansion, cost-cutting initiatives, or technology upgrades. All these factors can be addressed to reduce wastage. Other types of root causes—such as design and planning failures, innovation failures, taxation or legal issues, asset cannibalization, wear and tear of assets, or environmental exposure—are relatively difficult to control and make a comparatively small contribution to the total value of unused assets.<sup><a></a><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>In financial accounting, an asset is a resource that is owned by a business and can be used to produce a future economic benefit. To ensure that users of financial statements, such as shareholders, creditors, suppliers, customers, and regulatory agencies, are presented a true and fair view of the company\'s financial position and performance, accounting standards require the value of assets to be correctly recorded in the balance sheet. If an asset present in the balance sheet is no longer useful, it must be written off. Asset write-offs can translate into a sizable impact on profitability and reduce a company\'s ability to benefit from its existing asset base.</p>\n<p>The good news is that it\'s possible for a company to minimize these write-offs by putting in place certain internal processes. This article offers suggestions for reducing unused-asset write-offs through the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Establish a digital database of all assets with details that will be useful when making future decisions about the disposition of unused assets;</li>\n<li>Address the root cause of each unused asset through process interventions;</li>\n<li>Utilize periodic physical verification as a tool to identify reusable assets; and</li>\n<li>Decide whether to store or sell each unused asset and follow the appropriate storage guidelines.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Executing these processes can help reduce asset write-offs significantly; some companies have even experienced reductions of up to 50 percent in these costs over the course of just one to two years. And there is more good news: These steps are applicable to any industry, and making those changes requires only a one-time effort.</p>\n<p>The following sections explain the four steps in detail.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1. Establish an asset database.</strong></p>\n<p>As organizations grow larger and more complex, a digital database of all assets becomes necessary for effective fixed-asset management and redeployment of unused assets. Such a database exists in most organizations in the form of a fixed-asset register (FAR), which is used to keep track of the book value of the assets and determine depreciation.

The items your company owns make doing day-to-day routines possible – from desks, chairs, and computers in the front office, to smart phones and scanners for your warehouse and field workers.

(233, 'How to make finance a force for sustainability', 'https://www.bruegel.org/blog-post/how-make-finance-force-sustainability', '<div><div>\n<p>Sustainable development is a holistic concept with three aspects: economic, social and environmental. Humanity is facing numerous sustainability challenges. Looking at the environment, we see climate change, land-use change, biodiversity loss and depletion of natural resources all destabilising the earth. And on the social front, poverty, hunger and a lack of health care reveal that many people live below basic social standards.\n</p>\n<p>Sustainable development means that current and future generations should have the resources they need, such as food, water, health care and energy, without overwhelming the earth’s natural processes. To guide the transformation towards a sustainable and inclusive economy, the United Nations has developed the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which will require behavioural change.\n</p>\n<p>Why should finance contribute to sustainable development? The main task of the financial system is to allocate funding to its most productive use, but a shift to sustainability means changing our ideas about what is “productive”. Finance can play a role in allocating investment to sustainable companies and projects and thus accelerate the transition to a low-carbon, circular economy. So sustainable finance considers how finance (investing and lending) interacts with economic, social and environmental issues.\n</p>\n<p>In this allocation role, finance can assist in strategic decisions on the trade-offs between sustainable goals. Moreover, investors can exert influence over the companies they invest in, so long-term investors can steer companies towards sustainable business practices. Finally, finance is good at pricing risk for valuation purposes, and can thus help to deal with the inherent uncertainty about environmental issues, such as the impact of carbon emissions on climate change. At their core both finance and sustainability look to the future, so there is scope for a new alignment\n</p>\n<h3>A new framework</h3>\n<p>Thinking about sustainable finance has gone through different stages over the last few decades (see Table 1). The focus is gradually shifting from short-term profit towards long-term value creation. In a new essay, I analyse these stages and provide a new framework for sustainable finance.\n</p>\n<p>Financial and non-financial firms traditionally adopt the shareholder model, with profit maximisation as the main goal. A first step in sustainable finance (1.0 in Table 1) would be for financial institutions to avoid investing in companies with very negative impacts, such as tobacco, cluster bombs or whale hunting. Indeed, some firms are starting to include social and environmental considerations in the stakeholder model (Sustainable Finance 2.0).\n</p>\n<p>But to move ahead, we need to adopt a stakeholder approach to finance, with benefits accruing to the wider community rather than just shareholders. In the essay, I highlight the tension between the shareholder and stakeholder models. Should policymakers allow a shareholder-oriented firm to take over a stakeholder-oriented firm? Or do we need to protect firms that are more advanced in terms of sustainability? Another key development is the move from risk to opportunity. While financial firms have started to avoid (very) unsustainable companies from a risk perspective (Sustainable Finance 1.0 and 2.0), the frontrunners are now increasingly investing in sustainable companies and projects to create long-term value for the wider community (Sustainable Finance 3.0).\n</p>\n<h3>Mobilising investment funds for the long term</h3>\n<p>One major obstacle to the adoption of sustainable finance is short-termism. The costs of action are borne now, while the benefits are in the future. The impact of economic activity on society, and even more so on the environment, is typically felt in the long term. So how can financial institutions commit their investment for the long term and steer business towards sustainable practices?\n</p>\n<p>In the essay, I make two concrete proposals. On the institutional front, I propose to introduce “loyalty shares” as an additional reward to shareholders if they have held on to their shares for a so-called loyalty period (for example three, five or ten years). This is an incentive for institutional investors to pursue a buy-and-hold strategy. It is also a reward for investors’ efforts on engagement with the companies in which they invest. This engagement on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues is a powerful force to steer companies towards sustainable business practices. Social and environmental externalities take place in the corporate sector, but the financial sector can pressure corporates to address these externalities effectively.\n</p>\n<p>On the investment side, I propose the creation of sustainable retail investment funds.

But what if the opposite is the case?</p>\n<p>When I first took up small-scale organic farming in the 1970s, I spent a lot of energy in developing new methods and machinery to increase efficiency in production. The early organic advocates went a long way to assure other growers, farmers, businesses and politicians that organic farming could be profitable, even within the prevailing economic system. Even more so, if externalities would be factored into the price (which they still are not).\xa0I see a similar discourse surrounding regenerative agriculture, permaculture, market gardening or artisanal bakery. But perhaps this assurance of profitability was misguided all along. What if profit is not desirable? What if the pursuit of profit is at the core of the ills of society?</p>\n<p>There is an ethical perspective on profit that questions if it is fair that capital owners get richer while workers don’t. That question is justified, and could be the subject of another essay, but fairness is outside of the scope of this article. My focus instead is on what implications profit has for the economy and the ever-growing use of resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Profit in the sustainability narrative</strong></p>\n<p>In the world of business, an enterprise is considered to be viable only if it is profitable. In the prevailing sustainability discourse, we are told that there is no contradiction between profitability and environmental or social progress. On the contrary,\xa0<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Sustainability/Our%20Insights/Profits%20with%20purpose/Profits%20with%20Purpose.ashx">profitability is seen a prerequisite for sustainable development</a>. Environmental politics is full of concepts such as “triple-bottom-line” and “people, planet, profit”. But, by and large, this is simply not correct. Profitability is incompatible with sustainability. Let me explain why.</p>\n<p>Profit derives from\xa0<em>a surplus</em> created by economic activities, a surplus after the costs, including capital costs, have been paid. Profit can be generated in different ways, through trade, through lending, through patents (and other forms of royalties) or through production of goods or services. Some profits created by trade or rents are essentially about redistribution of wealth. If I buy cheaply and sell dear, I can make a profit, but I have not created any additional value for the economy. My supplier and the buyer just paid me to facilitate their exchange (whether they need me or not is another story). Similarly, lending by banks redistributes capital from the borrower to the bank, which, in turn, share some of that capital (the rent or profit) with those that deposited their capital in their bank accounts (the borrower may or may not invest the money in some profit-making venture). My focus here is rather by the kind of profit generated in the\xa0<em>production</em>\xa0of goods or services.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>On the floor of Chicago Board of Trade, photo: Gunnar Rundgren</em></p>\n<p>Profit is not the same as making ends meet. It is quite apparent that you can’t run a business that is constantly losing money. Profit is also not about being able to maintain buildings and replace machinery that is worn out. Profit is about surplus, which will be invested in new enterprises and, consequently, generate new profits. Profit can, of course, also be used to increase consumption. But one person’s increase of consumption, means another person’s increase of production. If that other production also is profit-driven, \xadit will lead to the same result.</p>\n<p><strong>Pyramids, feasts, war, investment or simply less work?</strong></p>\n<p>Clearly, we can’t shun “profit” altogether.

Carbon emissions are expected to rebound to pre-pandemic levels, after industrial activity and levels of commuting dropped during covid. The gap between rich and poor has grown during global lockdowns, exposing even greater social divides and a gulf of opportunity. Gender and ethnic disparity remain, with women and minority groups still underrepresented in government and corporate leadership positions globally. And, as populations have grown over the past few decades, so too has consumption of natural resources and the amount of e-waste generated and not recycled.</p><h2>So, what is the future of sustainable finance and where are those mythical ‘soonicorns’ to be found?</h2><p>While sustainable finance – or SuFi – is still in its infancy, there are untapped opportunities at the intersection between ESG and circular business models, where finance and technology can drive a real, positive impact. This creates significant potential in four main areas, which I’ll come on to shortly, but let me start by saying how I think my own area, venture capital, can advance sustainability goals.</p><p>Being smart about how we allocate capital means we can help redress the balance in three ways. First, by developing clear ESG policies, focused on measurable outcomes. Second, by directing capital towards those companies most likely to deliver them. And third, by encouraging our own portfolio companies to measure the broader impact of their business decisions and activities and by holding executives accountable for the results. If we really drill down into the specifics of what sustainable looks like, and focus on measuring the desired outcomes, we can drive the kind of performance that’s going to tip the scale of change. Let’s use the power of the capital we invest in start-ups to create that change.</p><p>So, on to those all-important growth areas.</p><h3>Opportunity 1: ESG platforms for reporting and investing</h3><p>The frenzy in ESG compliance has triggered a need to “measure, measure, measure”, with credit agencies creating specific products, and ESG analytics start-ups mushrooming to front run the trend. Healthy streams of money have flowed to newcomers in this area but, in the absence of regulatory standards and industry-accepted practices, it is hard to identify who the ultimate winners will be. On the flip side, the ability to build trust with more accurate data and reporting will lead to improved capital allocation to companies that have a positive ESG impact.</p><h3>Opportunity 2: New ESG Assets</h3><p>S&amp;P’s Global Ranking expects sustainable bonds, including green, social and sustainability linked, to exceed $1.5 trillion in 2022, up by more than 50% on 2021 and from just $200 billion in 2018 As both private and public sector players tackle their climate commitments, I expect to see further diversification and innovation in investment products, ranging from institutional and retail carbon instruments to sustainability investment platforms and marketplaces.</p><p>I would venture that soon most, if not all financial instruments (especially those traded on publicly regulated markets) will couple their traditional financial performance indicators with qualitative ESG measures. Investors will care more what drives their return, and how the nitty gritty of these securities tie in to the real economy. A key factor that has hindered wider adoption of ESG standards among the capital markets community has been</p><p>the unproven link between sustainability and financial alpha. My hope is that these new ESG assets will cast much needed light on the topic and, as a believer in the positive correlation between ESG compliance and financial performance, such positive conclusions will further boost the sector, even beyond S&amp;P’s Global Ranking predictions.</p><h3>Opportunity 3: Increasing product as a service (PaaS)</h3><p>PaaS models are emerging across every industry, from automotive to IT hardware and industrial equipment. Just as with the ‘device-as-a-service’ sector, the compound annual growth rate is expected to hit 38% from 2021-25, reaching more than €476 billion globally.</p><p>The model helps reduce', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

It is an admirable and important contribution to the discussion about how to make individual firms more sustainable. Beyond this effort, we need the sustainable business community to join the ongoing systems level conversation about how to make the whole global economy truly sustainable, not merely less unsustainable. Without such a systemic shift, the sum of individual firm sustainability efforts will not translate into sustainable capitalism.</p><p>In the spirit of contemporary Chinese artist Ai Weiwei\'s belief - quoted in Sustainable Capitalism - that "liberty is about the right to question everything," we offer five questions as a beginning to this critical dialogue:</p><p><strong>1. Can we find the answers to economic unsustainability within conventional economics?</strong></p><p>The profound ramifications of climate change (and other such market failures) impact not only firms and their financial value, they impact our economic, social, political, and ecological systems. To recognise this reality, conventional economists would have us price ("internalise") the effects of this externality. But the compounding interconnections between global temperature rise, sea level rise, soil degradation, biodiversity loss, etc, make accurate pricing impractical, while some risks such as climate change have consequences that simply cannot be priced. Furthermore, the discount function embedded in conventional financial analysis all but ensures that the costs to be borne by our grandchildren tomorrow are not valued today.</p><p>We have therefore concluded that looking at the sustainability challenge through the lens of conventional economics and finance reinforces the error that got us into our current difficulties. As Einstein famously said: "We can\'t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them."</p><p>Instead, we should look to natural systems science to understand sustainability because it is by definition sustainable, unlike our modern global economy. Leading new economy thinkers from the sciences like Janine Benyus, author of Biomimicry, are already working on this new way of thinking.</p><p><strong>2. What does nature teach us about sustainable capitalism?</strong></p><p>If we look to nature as the model and measure for sustainability, we find that nature does not maximise the goals of its parts. Rather, nature limits the goals of each species to that which can benefit the system without drawing down on its future viability. A "framework that seeks to maximise long-term economic value creation" – the definition offered for sustainable capitalism – must first be constrained by the need for the economy writ large to carry on.</p><p>Innovative models, such as the <a href="http://www.evergreencoop.com/">Evergreen Cooperatives</a> in Cleveland, US, are sprouting up all over the country. Inspired by the $20bn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation">Mondragon Cooperatives</a> in Spain, Evergreen has established an umbrella organisation to provide a source of continuity for all of its cooperative enterprises. All co-operatives are expected to support a fellow co-op in distress, absorbing its excess labour capacity. Rather than reinvest or distribute all its profits, each co-op contributes to a fund that a distressed co-op can tap and that helps finance the next generation of cooperative businesses.</p><p><strong>3. Can we live within our ecological means?</strong></p><p>A natural system cannot continue to exist if it depletes the resources it depends on or ruins the capacity of its host to recycle its wastes. Sustainable Capitalism begins and ends with quotes from two leading thinkers on this issue, Herman Daly and Tim Jackson, but it fails to address the core challenge they have put to economics, mainstream finance and capitalism: how can an economic system that depends upon finite natural resources continue to grow exponentially? Resource constraints and limits to growth must be addressed in any credible discussion of the future of capitalism.</p><p>A paper by <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7263/full/461472a.html">Johan Rockström published in Nature in 2009</a> detailed what he and his team call the "safe operating space for humanity."

Even before the <em>Limits to Growth</em> report of 1972, many ecologists were concerned that our continual expansion of population and consumption, based on the ever-increasing rate at which we burn finite supplies of fossil fuels, would eventually lead to crises of resource depletion and pollution (including climate change) as well as catastrophic loss of wild nature. Dystopian outcomes would inevitably follow.</p>\n<p>This apprehension led environmentalists to strategize ways to avert collapse. The obvious solution was, in large measure, to persuade policy makers to curtail growth in population and consumption, while mandating a phase-out of fossil fuels.

Also, we need growth in order to pay back public and private debt, which has ballooned in recent years due to the expectation of future profits and tax revenues. Further, we must raise the living standards of people in poor countries, and poor people in rich countries, and the only way to do that is to expand trade and other economic activity.</p>\n<p><em>Fossil Fuels:</em> Yes, of course burning oil, coal, and natural gas is problematic in the long run, political and business leaders admitted. But until a cheaper energy source comes along, fossil fuels are necessary for economic growth (see “Economic Growth,” above).</p>\n<p>Together, these arguments were impenetrable—not because there weren’t any better counterarguments, but because they reflected the short-term imperatives of the economic system itself. It’s a system, after all, that has to keep moving and growing to survive. So, for environmentalists, it was back to the drawing board.</p>\n<p>After strategizing feverishly, they came up with what seemed like a winning formula. What if there could be “clean” energy sources cheaper than fossil fuels, and what if economic growth could be achieved without more resource extraction and waste dumping? In short, what if industry could profit by saving the planet? If this really turned out to be the case, two of the basic ecological contradictions of modern society (increasing rates of resource depletion and pollution) would disappear painlessly. Meanwhile, we could simply ignore the population issue and hope that it somehow takes care of itself as economic growth makes people more affluent and therefore likely to have fewer kids. Everybody wins!</p>\n<p>And so, starting in the 1980s, big environmental organizations relied to an ever-greater extent on partnering with corporations and on hopes for technological solutions to the growth dilemma. Climate change would be defeated through the development of renewable energy. The looming problem of resource depletion would vanish as a result of more efficiency and recycling. Pollution would disappear with the proliferation of harmless, biodegradable, recyclable materials. Building solar panels, manufacturing “green” products, and recycling old stuff would be profitable and would create jobs. Economic growth would be decoupled from environmental harms of all kinds. Our collective human economic metabolism would continue to increase in scale, but in ways that didn’t threaten wildlife or future generations of humans. Problems solved!</p>\n<p>To be fair, environmentalists have also lobbied for carbon taxes, various regulations, and government investment to jumpstart the shift to alternative technologies, and some environmentalists never got on board with the pro-growth propaganda. But usually the promise was front and center: with just an initial nudge, planet-saving would soon become a self-funding growth activity for industry.</p>\n<p>And here we are today. The opportunities for green growth have snowballed to the point where they are now seemingly endless', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

The one sided marketplace introduces implied volatility over historical, or expected volatility, as a better metric to judge a Uniswap pool’s performance from the perspective of liquidity providers. I will focus on Uniswap V2 for the sake of simplicity but the logic of the argument presented in this article can be extended to Uniswap V3 because of its similarity to V2.</p><p>Currently the most often touted metric of a pool’s performance is its yield from trading fees. Marketers of Uniswap pools like to display a pool’s two to three digit yield as an incentive for investors to provide liquidity in a pool. However, this is the wrong metric to judge a pool’s performance since it does not take into account the volatility of the underlying assets of the pool and therefore the expected impermanent loss.</p><h2>What is an Option?</h2><p>To better understand the similarity of a Uniswap liquidity pool to an option’s marketplace, one must first understand the characteristics of an option in traditional financial markets. An option is a financial contract that gives the buyer the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell an asset at a predetermined price, the strike price, prior to or at an expiration date.</p><figure><figcaption>Return profile of buying a call option.

This is referred to as optionality.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather, it is the probability of the option expiring in the money which is the most important metric. This probability, after taking some assumptions into consideration, can be measured with the volatility of the underlying asset.</p><h2>How are Options Priced?</h2><p>In traditional financial markets the Black Scholes Model is the most common model used to price traditional option contracts. The explanation of the Black Scholes Model is beyond the scope of this article, therefore to summarize its contributions, the Black Scholes Model identifies the characteristics of the underlying asset and option contract that drive the price of the option. Its most significant inference is that the volatility of the underlying asset is the most important factor in determining the price of the option. That is because the greater the volatility, the higher the likelihood that the option will expire in the money (be profitable upon exercise).</p><figure><figcaption>When the volatility is high, it is more likely that the underlying price will cross the strike price.</figcaption></figure><p>Hence the proper way to price an option is in terms of its implied volatility, that is the volatility the option’s current premium implies the market expects. Since, assuming that there is no arbitrage opportunity, at this volatility the option’s premium does not convey any advantage to the seller or buyer of the option. That is, under the no arbitrage principle of asset valuation, whatever profit the buyer of the option could make will be on average negated by the premium she paid for the option. Just as whatever profit the option seller can make will be on average negated by the loss she will experience when the option expires in the money</p><figure><figcaption>The value of the option premiums is the discounted expected value of the difference between the underlying asset’s price in the future and the option’s strike price.

It mirrors the underlying, wherein the fluctuations in the value of that asset influence the value of the derivative itself. The security can take many forms. Aside from stocks and commodities, you can also use derivative instruments on indices, currency or <a href="https://www.fpmarkets.com/products/forex-trading/forex-trading-accounts/">Forex</a>, and interest rates. </p>\n<p><b>Using derivatives isn’t a new concept</b></p>\n<p>If you think about it, the use of derivatives has been around for a quite some time, particularly in the farming industry. </p>\n<p>For example, a wheat producer might agree to sell his/her product to a wheat bread manufacturer in 6 months at the current market price of $12 regardless of the future market price. By signing the contract, the two parties locked in the price of wheat, with the producer is seeking to protect himself/herself against the expected decrease in the price of wheat and the manufacturer is seeking to protect him/herself against the expected increase in the price of wheat. </p>\n<p>If the price of the commodity falls after 6 months, from $12 to $10, the wheat bread manufacturer loses since he/she could’ve bought the wheat at a cheaper price if he/she had not signed the contract. In this deal, the wheat producer gains $2 profit. Conversely, if the price of the wheat rises, the wheat producer loses since he/she could’ve sold the commodity at a higher price if he/she had not signed the contract. The manufacturer gains profit.</p>\n<p><b>Why Investors Use Derivatives</b></p>\n<p>There are two main uses for derivatives;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b> To hedge a risk. </b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>An investor can hedge or mitigate risk in the underlying asset by entering into a derivative contract. Derivative hedgers try to reduce the risk exposure and are not motivated by profit in the derivative market itself; they seek to limit risk by using a derivative instrument (contract) as insurance policies and are indirectly increasing profitability. </p>\n<ol>\n<li><b> To speculate</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Speculating is a technique used by investors when betting on the future price of a security. Derivative speculators, on the other hand, are motivated completely by seeking profit and are willing to take big risks for massive returns. With derivatives that offer investors the opportunity to leverage their positions, they can execute large speculative plays at a low cost. </p>\n<p><b>Four Main Types of Derivatives</b></p>\n<p>Four of the most common examples of derivative instruments are Forwards, Futures, Options, and Swaps. </p>\n<ol>\n<li><b> Forwards</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>A forward (or forward contract) is a customized, non-standardized contract between two parties to buy and sell a security at a specified time at a specified future date at a price agreed upon today. Forwards are not traded on a central exchange, thus are not standardized to regulate. That said, they are helpful for hedging a risk. </p>\n<ol>\n<li><b> Futures</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Forwards and futures are quite similar but unlike the former, futures are regulated and standardized. A future is a standardized contract between two parties to buy or sell a specific asset of standardized quality and quantity for a price agreed today (called the “future price”) with payment and delivery occurring at a determined future date', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Advanced traders use it focusing on many market factors, which allows them to extract income from intraday price fluctuations.</em></blockquote><div><p>At times of high volume on the market, a large number of orders appear, which are structured by DOM. The tool displays all open orders, which will further affect the pricing. It helps to evaluate the superiority of demand and supply and determine the most liquid price level.</p><p><strong>The order book has the following features:</strong></p></div><ul><li>A graphical representation of available liquidity on each priceline. </li><li>All orders are displayed only with a set cost.</li><li>Each order has several sellers and buyers.</li><li>It does not distinguish between stop orders for closing positions, orders for opening and purchases on borrowed funds</li></ul><p><strong>The Effectiveness of the DOM</strong></p><div><p>The approaches to the implementation of trade are constantly being improved by market participants, and therefore more updated trading strategies constantly arise. That is why today traders use the Depth of Market to a lesser extent then they used it relevant earlier. The point is, that despite the useful properties of this indicator, processing such a huge array of orders is an uncomfortable moment in the work, which also makes it difficult to assess the current trading situation. Often there are some hidden and fictitious orders, which negatively affect the productivity of inexperienced traders. The advantage of the book of orders usage remains, but it is achieved through the combination of the chart and the order tape (time &amp; sales). That allows users to identify the target stock within a certain price range.</p><p><strong>The Importance of Trading Volume</strong></p></div><p><div><p></p></div></p><div><p>Trading volume is one of the most closely watched indicators for tracking the general activity of the market, which shows the volume of purchase and sale of securities. It is the total number of stocks, bonds or commodity futures contracts sold over a given period. Daily, exchanges publish data on the volume of trades, both for individual transactions and the total amount of trades completed on the exchange. The trading volume shows market liquidity, as well as supply and demand for securities. It also reflects price dynamics. When a market activity is low, investors expect a slower moving of prices. When market activity rises, prices usually move in the same direction. A low level of security may indicate a lack of confidence among investors. It can generate price volatility and mirror factors that, from an investment point of view are untrustworthy. In contrast, the high volume of a particular security may indicate that traders trust investment in the long run. It also gives investors more time to determine when it’s the right time to sell for a profit.</p><p><strong>A Build Stage of Support &amp; Resistance</strong></p></div><div><p>The concept of support and resistance lines is extremely simple and serves as the basis for technical analysis', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Knowing a thing or two about arbitrage, high yield trading, and financial engineering, I decided to write my first Medium article, to illustrate what arbitrage is, its different flavors, and what I see are some of the opportunities in cryptocurrencies out there.

Green Bonds have been emerging as a trend in financial markets everywhere, with Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst, Daniel Shurey, predicting that, in 2019, anywhere between <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-24/what-are-green-bonds-and-how-green-is-green-quicktake">$170 billion</a> and $180 billion of Green Bonds would be sold.

Essentially, <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/investment/what-is-a-bond">bonds</a> are a form of a loan from a private investor to a company or government. The issuer of the bond, usually the government or a corporation, asks groups of private investors for certain amounts of money. If the investors believe in the stability of a company and its ability to pay back its debts, they will loan the issuer the amount that they are asking for. In other words, this would be the investor purchasing the bond. These bonds have a set maturation date, which is the date at which the issuer will return the principal amount to the investors. At the time of purchase, the bonds will also have a set <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/investment/what-is-a-bond">coupon rate</a>, which is the interest that the bond pays to the investors. Bonds that are more unstable, less likely to reach maturation, and are paid back in a longer timeframe tend to be riskier investments, and are thus often compensated with high interest rates and high potential returns. Contrastingly, bonds from more financially predictable actors that reach maturation quicker tend to have lower interest rates because of their high probability of returns.</p>\n<p>The key difference between bonds and other forms of traditional investments, such as stocks or derivatives, is that bonds do not actually grant the owner any ownership stake in a company or government. As a result, bonds tend to be more <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/investment/what-is-a-bond">stable</a> forms of investment, both for the loaner and the loanee, because the value of the money loaned does not fluctuate with the', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Fintech is no different in this regard. Every company specialises in its own niche and can bring its expertise and unique experience to the collective project making itself irreplaceable. But the minute each brand decides to take care of every aspect of the project without external support - it loses right away due to insufficient competencies and expertise.\xa0</p><h2><strong>It is a win-win\xa0</strong></h2><p>First and foremost two or more companies cooperating will benefit from using each other’s products, which they would not be able to produce at this standard on their own. They can also decrease the production cost, boost their sales and most importantly create the most effective product for the customers thus, retaining the existing ones and acquiring new clientele. Obviously, partnerships require constant engagement between the parties. If the communication on one side is neglected or the partners do not engage equally, it is very likely that the trust between them will not be fully developed and the product will not achieve its full potential.\xa0</p><h2><strong>Building credibility &amp; reducing development costs\xa0</strong></h2><p>Partnering with established financial institutions can help many fintech companies gain credibility and legitimacy in the eyes of their current and prospective consumers, as well as other stakeholders. This can be particularly important for fintech companies that are operating in heavily regulated industries, such as banking and insurance. Additionally, since building new technology from scratch can be expensive and time-consuming, by teaming up with others, each fintech company can share development costs and repackage or bundle products and services more effectively and efficiently saving their budget for other priorities.\xa0</p><h2><strong>One partnership takes on the other\xa0</strong></h2><p>If you team up with one partner and your cooperation turns into a fruitful experience with positive results, there is a high chance that you will be introduced to the partners of their partners! It works the same as networking. You grow your chain network through building relationships with different people and in the case of fintech, it is mostly with the suppliers, aggregator providers and innovators etc.\xa0Knowing many of them will enable you to diversify your partners depending on the project you’re working on and choose the most suitable one.\xa0</p><h2><strong>Your client gets the best product possible</strong></h2><p>Every company specialises in its niche, such as payments or lending, and usually does not have expertise in other areas. By partnering with other fintech companies, you can gain access to new technology and expertise that can help you improve your products and services. Additionally, you can enhance your own product offerings and provide more comprehensive solutions to your customers. For example, in October 2022, AAZZUR partnered with Solaris, Europe’s leading embedded finance platform. Thanks to this partnership, AAZZUR utilised the regulatory and technical expertise of Solaris, thus increasing its number of compliance-ready core banking products. In return, it offered front-end layers, integration and value-added financial products to German clients of both companies.</p><p>Through the partnership, Solaris combined AAZZUR’s best-in-class front-end technology with the Solaris BaaS platform, enabling anyone to embed financial products instantly and at the point of need in a simple interface. The cooperation between experienced partners in the BaaS space opened up many opportunities for Solaris and their partners to make products even more customer-centric.<br /></p></div><div><p><b>About the author:\xa0</b>\xa0<a href="http://https//www.linkedin.com/in/philippbuschmann/%C2%A0">Philipp Buschmann</a>, co-founder and CEO at <a href="https://www.aazzur.com/">AAZZUR\xa0</a>, a one-stop shop for smart embedded finance experience.

With SavvyMoney, the $1.3 billion asset credit union’s members can opt in to free credit monitoring for online and mobile banking, instant access to what’s impacting their credit score, real-time alerts, and more.</p>\n<p>“It’s a solution we think is transformational for our members,” Stearns says, noting any partnership should start with the question, “What are our members going to experience?”</p>\n<p>However, a strong credit union-fintech relationship isn’t just about the product the fintech provides.</p>\n<p>“What mattered most to us was that we found a partner that allowed our members to feel the impact quickly, that represented our brand well, and whose values aligned,” Stearns says.</p>\n<p>‘A really good partner for credit unions is someone that’s listening closely and is willing to hear the pain points.’</p>\n<p>Tansley Stearns</p>\n<p>Values alignment builds inherent trust between new partners. That trust enabled the relationship between Community Financial and SavvyMoney to progress quickly.</p>\n<p>“Because Tansley established trust and said, ‘This is a partner, this isn’t a vendor,’ her team reached out to ours and said, ‘What do we need to do to do everything that SavvyMoney does extremely well?’” Fraenza says. “There wasn’t hesitation, there wasn’t, ‘SavvyMoney is going to try to sell us something else.’ It was, ‘Let’s sit down at the table, figure out what other partners have done, and figure out how we can replicate that.’</p>\n<p>“And it wasn’t just one conversation,” Fraenza continues. “It was the lending team reaching out to us … marketing reaching out to us … \xa0IT … having commitment from all parties involved makes for an exceptional partnership.”</p>\n<p>What starts as an exceptional partnership doesn’t always finish that way. Therefore, it’s crucial for both the credit union and the fintech to be flexible and willing to adapt as the relationship progresses and the market changes.</p>\n<p>“A really good partner for credit unions is someone that’s listening closely and is willing to hear the pain points,” Stearns says.</p>\n<p>“You’re not on this island alone,” Fraenza agrees. “Just because we’re a technology company and that’s what we do, we don’t have to stop there. Hold your partners accountable for that. Make sure they’re teaching you best practices, make sure you’re having check-in calls. It shouldn’t be ‘I don’t know who my rep is.’”</p>\n<p></p></div></div>', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

This\xa0not only speeds up time-to-value and time-to-market but also helps financial enterprises stay\xa0as their customers' main financial providers.\xa0</p>\n<p>Moreover, fully engaged customers bring significant benefits. According to Gallup, retail\xa0banking customers who are fully engaged contribute 37% more annual revenue to their\xa0primary bank than customers who are actively disengaged. These highly engaged\xa0customers\n also tend to have more products with their bank and maintain higher deposit\xa0balances in their accounts.</p>\n<p>Digital Banking Report’s Retail Banking Trends and Priorities 2023 revealed that\xa0collaborations with fintech companies and third-party solution providers have enabled 60%\xa0of financial enterprises to successfully address the digital banking requirements of\n their\xa0customers.\xa0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, many financial enterprises struggle to keep up with changing expectations.They often lack a deep understanding of their customer's needs and don't have the\xa0necessary digital expertise to capitalise on them.

But this creates a challenge of its own: delivering highly personalised experiences while\xa0delivering a consistent brand experience, at scale. This is near impossible without\n the\xa0necessary technology and systems.</p>\n<p><br />\nImproving customer engagement also requires a shift in thinking, from the traditional\xa0product-focused approach to a customer-focused one. When done right, this change of\xa0focus allows financial institutions to find new growth opportunities by offering more\xa0immediate\n and future value to customers.</p>\n<p><br />\nThe most successful partnerships will be those that focus on design-led platforms, have\xa0proven track records, demonstrate a bias towards execution and offer short-term, fixed-price\xa0innovation contracts.

Nowhere is this truer than in the financial services industry, which is undergoing a significant shift as the ecosystem is increasingly dominated by partnerships rather than solo enterprises. Competition is intensifying, and we have already seen that tech giants Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon are all taking steps to break into the financial sector. Partnerships are critical to staying ahead in a crowded market: partnering with the best companies specializing in a niche area saves time and resources, improves product time to market, and helps to accelerate the business’ learning curve.</p>\n<div><p></p><p>Viktoria Ruubel</p></div>\n<p>Borders are getting blurred: a few years ago, no one would have anticipated the extent to which big industry players have invested in and become reliant on partnerships. Large established banks are partnering with fintech startups; financial players and retailers are partnering to bring new services to their customers; and established financial institutions are partnering with enterprises they traditionally regarded as competitors in order to extend their business into new customer segments.</p>\n<p>‘Amazon can do it all; all others must partner,’ this was the key message from this year’s Lendit Fintech conference in San Francisco, where big fintech companies were describing how they plan to use partnerships to improve their customer experience, technology, distribution or acquisition channels, as well as access to top talent. Businesses in the financial industry, no matter their size or location, should be partnering with distributors, technology vendors, small niche innovative companies, players from other industries, or even with competitors to gain an edge in the crowded marketplace.</p>\n<p>However, partnerships must be aligned with the company’s strategy and values; and they should benefit both partners in order to ensure long-term alignment and the longevity of the collaboration. There are multiple reasons as to why businesses and fintech companies utilise partnerships to meet their strategic objectives:<strong>\xa0</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>New or improved technology capabilities</strong><em>\xa0</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is the most common type of fintech collaboration we see – where a fintech company or software development company provides its underlying technology or software to banks and other financial institutions in the form of a white-label. For the financial institutions, the partnership means they have immediate access to the latest, state-of-the-art technology stack or a new capability to expand faster into new markets or to reach new customer segments without in-house development efforts. It speeds up time to market and helps with lowering the costs that would otherwise be required to build the new capabilities from scratch in-house. Meanwhile fintech startups get access to low-cost funding through a trusted partnership, and the software providers invest in adding new capabilities to their portfolio of services. There are many examples of this type of partnership including OnDeck and JPMorgan Chase, and Mambu and N26.<strong>\xa0</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>New acquisition channels</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the real challenges facing any high-growth oriented company, be it a young challenger bank or a mature fintech aiming to speed up its scaling, is finding and sustaining efficient customer acquisition channels. Partnering with organisations with an existing, large customer base is appealing as it provides access to hundreds of thousands of customers that can benefit immediately from the attractive fintech offering. Meanwhile the partner provides additional value to their customer base and adds the possibility of new monetization opportunities. A great example is the collaboration between Affirm and Walmart announced in February this year.<strong>\xa0</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Improved digital customer experience</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Customers are increasingly turning to digital channels to manage all aspects of their life; financial services is just one industry being revolutionised by digital. With customer expectations for a seamless service ever-increasing, providing fast, convenient digital services has become critical for banks if they want to keep customers satisfied and sustain their competitive advantage. For established banks, partnering with a fintech organisation offers an accelerated path to providing the best customer experience, which can be difficult to develop in-house due to outdated systems.

But by working with them instead of against them, community banks can better compete with the megabanks and other tech-forward competitors. Here’s how.</strong></p>\n<p><em>By Karen Epper Hoffman</em></p>\n<p>Nearly a quarter century ago, Microsoft founder Bill Gates famously stated that “banks are dinosaurs.” And so began the love-hate relationship between technology companies and financial institutions that exists to this day. </p>\n<p>Even now, U.S. banks see financial technology upstarts (or “fintechs”) as both their best friend and, potentially, their worst enemy, as they vie to develop new means of engaging customers. </p>\n<p>Kevin Tweddle, ICBA group executive vice president for innovation and financial technology, points out that many community bank executives are worried that “fintechs would take over and compete. … But for the banks willing to partner, it’s a win-win.” </p>\n<p>And community banks offer an appealing draw for these potential fintech partners as well: While a smaller community bank may offer less reach, fewer customers and less brand recognition than a super-regional or money center institution, community banks are nimble, can offer entry to the C-suite and typically operate with less red tape than a fintech would experience working with a megabank. </p>\n<p>Brian Unruh is CEO of $662 million-asset NBKC Bank in Overland Park, Kan., which co-ran a fintech accelerator as of October 1 (<a href="http://staging1.independentbanker.org/?p=19244">see Trailblazer article</a>). He says that for his community bank, it has been “rewarding and enlightening to help many [fintechs] work through these challenges while simultaneously working toward solving our strategic initiatives.”\xa0</p>\n<p>Unruh adds, “Working closely with the founders of these companies is energizing, and we are continuously learning a great deal. They have such commitment and focus on solving a particular problem.”</p>\n<p>As Tweddle points out, the community bank market is “quite dynamic and collaborative. Big banks may have bigger budgets, but in dealing with the red tape of a bigger bank, some of these fintechs may run through all their cash before they get their first deal off the ground.” And, he adds, when one community bank has success in working with a fintech partner, it is more apt to spread the word. “They’ll call all their other community banking friends,” Tweddle says, “which helps scale the business.” </p>\n<h2>Growing collaboration</h2>\n<p>Indeed, regional and community banks are increasingly looking to fintechs to help them connect with customers and prospects (see sidebar, end of article). </p>\n<p>According to a report by Manatt, Phelps\xa0&amp; Phillips, LLP, executives are “optimistic” about future collaboration between the two industries. Fifty-four percent of bank respondents cal fintechs a potential partner, and 89 percent say they believe partnerships between the two will captivate the industry over the next 10 years. </p>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>54%</strong></h2>\n<p>of bank respondents call fintechs a potential partner</p>\n<h2><strong>89%</strong></h2>\n<p>say partnerships between banks and fintechs will captivate the industry over the next decade</p>\n<p>Source: Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips, LLP</p>\n</div>\n<p>In particular, Tweddle says there is a lot of momentum around fintech partnering in lending and payments. According to VentureScanner, 72 percent of venture funding to fintechs is going to firms specializing in these two areas. “That’s where it’s at, because bankers are always looking to be more efficient in those two areas,” Tweddle points out. “Lending is the number-', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

One of the earliest players was BankSimple, which launched its beta version in 2012. BBVA, an original investor, acquired what is now known as Simple two years later.</p>\n<p>Ten years back, “disruption” typically referred to fintech firms’ tough talk about replacing traditional banks, notes Ron Shevlin, Director of Research at Cornerstone Advisors. Shevlin and other commentators said at the time that they didn’t think replacement was in the cards.</p>\n<p>Gradually, the fintech vocabulary evolved so that “disruption” came to refer to changing consumer behavior in banking, until finally, says Shevlin, talk of disruption has evolved further towards a more collaborative environment. Now, traditional banking and the fintech industry work together to provide new services, or at least new twists on traditional services.</p>\n<p>Often this talk comes around to fintech partnerships. To Shevlin the industry has both overused and misused this term. In years past, traditional financial technology providers tended to refer to their banking clients a “partners,” says Shevlin. Whenever he heard such talk, he says, “I thought that any bank or credit union executive hearing that was thinking, ‘These guys are <em>anything</em> but my ‘partner’.”</p>\n<h4>“What is emerging is something between a true partnership and a vendor relationship.”</h4>\n<p>Today when financial institution leaders speak of the need to partner with fintech, they aren’t referring to major tech vendors nor even established fintechs. Instead, they usually mean the pure fintech startups still trying to get traction.</p>\n<p>“They are not partnerships as in, ‘Let’s go to market together and see what happens. We’ll split the resources that are needed. And we’ll split the rewards’,” says Shevlin. Instead, what is emerging is something between a true partnership and a vendor relationship.</p>\n<p>Partnership will likely remain a gray area for some time. “At the end of the day, you build, you buy, or you partner,” says Sam Kilmer, Senior Director at Cornerstone. Figuring out just where your institution’s arrangement sits, in the third category, will often hinge on how “vested” the financial institution and the fintech are in each other.</p>\n<p>Kilmer points out that some bank CEOs, even among smaller institutions, have actually made investments in fintechs they are working with, much like BBVA made in Simple years ago.</p>\n<p>The flip side, for the fintech, concerns how many product or service relationships the financial institution maintains with it. Four or five ties signals a strong connection. Making this less likely than might otherwise be the case, adds Kilmer, is a growing tendency among banking institutions to adopt an à la carte approach. He calls this “best of breed” tech adoption.</p>\n<h2>Making Fintech Partnerships Work Isn’t Easy</h2>\n<p>Like most trendy talk in financial services, fintech partnerships sound great in theory. They can be harder to make work in practice.</p>\n<h4>“Like peanut butter and chocolate, financial institutions and fintechs find themselves poised for partnership and ready to make each other a lot of money. But real progress requires more than a sugar high in a flashy wrapper.”<br />\n— Cornerstone Advisors report</h4>\n<p>A report from Cornerstone based on research on both <a href="https://hs.crnrstone.com/fintech-relationships">sides of these customer relationships</a> puts the challenge succinctly: “Like peanut butter and chocolate, financial institutions and fintechs find themselves poised for partnership and ready to make each other a lot of money.

Over the past few months, the Decentralized Finance ecosystem has grown into a vibrant and fascinating sandbox for financial innovation. Even though we are seeing new all-time highs for total value locked in DeFi, trading volumes, daily active users and online engagement, DeFi still has a lot of growth ahead of itself.</p><p>But which subsection of the DeFi space will see the most explosive growth? We believe decentralized derivatives is currently the single most promising investment opportunity in DeFi today, and here are five reasons why:</p><h2>The market for derivatives is the largest market in the world</h2><p><strong>Did you know that the derivatives market is the single largest financial market in the world? </strong>In fact, the derivatives market is about <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052715/how-big-derivatives-market.asp">10 times larger compared to the credit market</a> and 20 times larger than the global GDP. Derivatives aren’t only used by professional traders, but they are an important component of financial services that we use every day. Personal checking accounts, insurances, and mortgages all cannot exist without the use of derivatives!</p><h2>Derivatives are crucial to every mature financial system</h2><figure><figcaption><em>A lot of everyday financial products are using derivatives</em></figcaption></figure><p>Let’s consider why derivatives are used this often and why they are critical to any financial system. It’s because financial systems are made up of financial markets, and financial markets are all about risks — every single transaction comes with a degree of risk. Professional market participants, such as traders, banks and investment firms will want to offset or “hedge” these risks in order to prevent financial disaster in case of unforeseen events such as high price volatility. This is where derivatives such as options and futures are used. Derivatives allow for market participants to manage their risks by limiting the potential returns and losses. Simply said, derivatives smooth out returns and losses and therefore prevent financial crises.</p><h2>DeFi won’t mature unless derivatives grow</h2><figure><figcaption><em>Relative size of global markets</em></figcaption></figure><p>In any significant financial system, the typical market size ratio between money/debt/derivatives is 1/10/100. In DeFi today, this is not even nearly the case. Let’s consider these market sizes in the illustration below, just to get a feeling for the numbers.</p><p>Where will this growth in the derivatives market come from? It will come from multiple sources, all explained in this article. Let’s start with the growth from within the current DeFi user base!</p><p><strong>Today’s DeFi users are exposed to significant risks</strong> and most of them are not yet aware, until <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/yams-market-cap-falls-from-60m-to-zero-in-35-minutes">another systemic failure occurs</a> and people lose their funds.

Currently, this market is well over 10 trillion dollars; the latest <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy2105.htm">statistics</a> from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) show over-the-counter (OTC) trades grossed $15.8 trillion during the first half of 2020. </p> <p>So, how does this market work? Let’s define what derivatives are for starters as we narrow down to the different markets, including crypto derivatives - the latest kid in the block. Fundamentally, derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from an underlying asset. Derivative contracts can be defined by various underlying assets such as commodities, indexes, currencies, interest payments, bonds and crypto assets. </p> <p>Unlike spot markets where stakeholders are directly exposed to an asset, the derivative market allows traders to purchase contracts that indirectly expose them to the price movements of an underlying asset. Most traders in traditional financial markets and nascent ecosystems like crypto use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. This is because the derivative contracts are settled at a future date instead of the actual purchase date. </p> </div> <p> </p><h2>Derivatives as Market Hedging Instruments </h2> <p></p> <div> <p>With derivatives, traders can purchase a futures or forward contract that allows them to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price hence the right and obligation to exercise the contract upon maturity. These contracts feature predetermined expiry dates and prices, allowing speculators to bet on whether the price of an underlying asset will be higher or lower than its market price on the settlement date. </p> <p>For instance, a trader can use derivative instruments to hedge against the eventuality that oil prices will be higher on a settlement date scheduled six months from now. In this case, they would buy a futures contract with a lower settlement price than their predictions. </p> <p>Should the prediction be correct, the trader will be in the money as they will purchase the oil cheaper than the prevailing market prices. On the other hand, a trader would be out of the money if their predictions were higher than the spot prices on the settlement date. </p> <p>As mentioned earlier, derivatives go way back to the 17th century, with the Dojima rice exchange marking the debut of this market. Well, it is no longer limited to commodities or financial instruments such as equities. The derivative market has found its way into the crypto ecosystem and now accounts for over half of the total crypto volumes, according to the latest <a href="https://data.cryptocompare.com/reports/exchange-review-october-2021">report</a> by CryptoCompare. </p> </div> <p> </p><h2>The Rise of Crypto Derivatives</h2> <p></p> <div> <p>Though a relatively new market, cryptocurrencies have proven to match the wild west when it comes to the rate of innovation. Today, most leading crypto exchanges, including Binance, FTX and Deribit, offer Bitcoin and Ether futures. It is no surprise that some analysts are now using the open interest data for BTC and ETH futures to predict future crypto market prices. Notably, the crypto market has experienced substantial volatility swings during monthly and quarterly settlement dates in the previous year. </p> <p>While centralized exchanges dominate the crypto derivatives market, there has been an increased interest in DeFi derivatives, especially with crackdowns by authorities such as China’s CCP, which recently went hard on crypto miners and exchanges. DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance, changes the narrative of centralized financial services by introducing smart contract platforms governed through code and communities instead of a third party. </p> <p>In the early DeFi days, the most focus was on decentralized exchanges (DEXes), giving rise to Uniswap and Sushiwap.

After Thursday’s brief insanity on Wall Street, I couldn’t help but go back to it.</p> \n<p>The paper is charmingly titled “When Will God Destroy Our Money?” The key passage is this:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>A very large coronal mass ejection from the sun that could cause a super solar storm if it should hit the earth might wipe out the global money system within minutes from impact. Stock exchanges would not operate, banking systems would not function, and both credit cards and ATM machines would stop working.

He cites a recent National Academy of Sciences <a href="http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12507">report</a> that says a 1921-strength storm could knock out electrical power for more than 130 million people in the U.S.</p> \n<p>Haug’s point is that nobody really has the faintest idea when a 1921-strength storm — or a far stronger one that <em>could</em> destroy all our money — might hit again. As his sometime co-author <a href="/2009/10/the-six-mistakes-executives-make-in-risk-management/ar/1">Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a> has been telling us all for the past decade, standard bell-curve statistics is no help at all in understanding or predicting the extreme “black swan” events that can change the world in an instant.</p> \n<p>That’s one possible line of reasoning. Another has to do with just how fragile the complex systems we’ve created to manage our economic lives have become. Exchange officials are still trying to puzzle out what exactly happened to cause the price of dozens of stocks to suddenly plummet by more than 60%. But it seems likely that it has something to do with the new infrastructure of high-frequency trading that now accounts for the bulk of stock market activity.</p> \n<p>To function well, stock exchanges need market makers — that is, firms that are willing to keep buying and selling in a particular stock at all times.

Within the space of about 20 minutes the prices of thousands of securities on Wall Street collapsed, sometimes by more than 60%, before recovering almost as quickly. It is not so much a whodunnit as a whydidit?</p><p>An official report pointed to a sell order in the futures market as the spark. But that still raises the question of why, in a supposedly efficient market, a single transaction caused so much chaos.</p><p>The answer, according to a recent paper<a href="#footnote1">*</a> by Giovanni Cespa of the Cass Business School and Thierry Foucault of HEC Paris, lies in the way that market participants try to control their risks. Like a retailer on the high street, securities dealers carry an inventory so they can fulfil their customers’ orders. That means they incur the risk that a sudden price plunge will cause them to offload their inventory at a loss, just as greengrocers suffer when they try to flog pumpkins after Halloween.</p><p>To safeguard themselves dealers monitor liquidity signals in other asset classes. These, they reason, may give them useful information about the assets they hold on their own books. If one asset suddenly becomes illiquid, that may indicate a change in the risk appetite of investors. As a result dealers will become less willing to provide liquidity in other markets, too. That will mean either that the gap between bids and offers will widen, or that individual buy-and-sell orders will have a much bigger effect on prices.</p><p>In consequence a liquidity shock in one asset class may have an effect in others, as dealers become ever more risk-averse. In the words of Mr Cespa and Mr Foucault, “dealers’ beliefs about the informativeness of the prices and liquidity of other securities are self-fulfilling.” In short order markets can turn from being very liquid to being highly illiquid.</p><p>In some circumstances—a bad piece of economic news, say, or a default by a large debtor—a sudden loss of liquidity may be quite understandable. All assets sometimes have to be repriced to take account of a change in fundamentals. But sometimes an individual asset may fall for entirely idiosyncratic reasons—a software glitch on a dealer’s computer, for example. The effect on other markets may be similar, however, because dealers still interpret the liquidity decline as conveying useful information.</p><p>What role do high-frequency traders play in this process? Lots of them look for examples of mispriced securities, hoping to make profits by buying and selling them but adding liquidity to the markets in the process. But they, too, depend on being able to trade with the dealers: if liquidity dries up, the high-frequency traders will also become less active.</p><p>The authors say that the disappearance of high-frequency traders during the flash crash was most obvious in the world of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These funds consist of baskets of securities, usually linked to an index. In theory the value of an ETF should closely follow the value of the securities it owns. When the two prices get out of line, high-frequency traders are often the ones stepping in to make a profit. But ETFs were among the most illiquid assets during the flash crash, suggesting that high-frequency traders had pulled back from this market.</p><p>All this can happen very rapidly, as the flash crash demonstrated. But what can be done about it? Many exchanges already have circuit-breakers in place so that trading is halted once prices have fallen by a significant amount. These safeguards date back to “Black Monday” 25 years ago, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by almost 23%.</p><p>The authors suggest that a liquidity circuit-breaker should apply as well. A version already exists on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Trading is halted if there is a huge imbalance in buy and sell orders that is likely to lead to an exaggerated change in price. Something similar could be designed for other markets.</p><p>It may seem perverse to respond to market illiquidity by halting all trading. It sounds a bit like responding to food shortages by closing down all supermarkets. But the idea is to give investors and traders time to pause and reflect. This should prevent illiquidity from spreading.</p><p>It is surely in the long-term interest of the markets that events like the flash crash are avoided.

This article reveals a few less-known but notable events drawn from the past half-millennium that might pique your own interest in the rivers of time that have led us to the present day.</p>\n<h2>\n\tHolland’s Famed Tulipmania Was Driven by Two Viruses</h2>\n<p>\n\tYou are probably acquainted with the fabled “tulipmania” that gripped Holland during the early 1600s. What most people don’t know is that two viruses played central roles in this drama.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe tulip bulbs themselves were classified into three groups: the single-colored, the multi-colored, and the</p>\n<p>\n\t“bizarres.” This last category is most important, as bizarres were the rarest and most sought-after tulip. The reason these unusual flowers came about was due to a virus that interfered with the plant’s ability to create a uniform color on the petal. It is today known as a “breaking” virus, since it breaks the plant’s lock on a single petal color without killing the plant. The effect on the flower was striking, producing mosaic-like flames of color on each petal. Of course, the Dutch of the time knew nothing of such things; they merely took a strong liking to these rare and unusual flowers.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs tulipmania neared its frenzied peak, an outbreak of bubonic plague emerged in the land. The psychological effects of this varied from person to person, but for some, it created a reckless, fatalistic disregard for financial risk, since no one was sure if they would be alive or dead in the months ahead. The same plague was also to blame when an important auction of tulip bulbs took place and not a single buyer showed up, ostensibly out of fear of the disease. Of course, plenty of sellers were there, but with no one to sell to, it swiftly became apparently that the top was in, and holders of the bulbs scrambled to get out at any price.</p>\n<h2>\n\t1720s France and 1930s U.S. Share an Important Similarity</h2>\n<p>\n\tIn early 18th century France, John Law had revolutionized finance in the country by introducing paper money in lieu of specie (money in coin). As the frenzy surrounding the mania known later as “The Mississippi Scheme” turned into panic, banks were under terrible stress from holders of the paper notes who demanded their “real” money (that is, precious metals) back.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the crowds pressed in, the Royal Bank took measures to try to slow down the extraction of real money from its vaults. For example, if a person came to withdraw gold in exchange for notes, the teller would count out the change at a comically slow pace, thus frustrating the others in line and reducing the amount that physically could be taken out in the business day.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother trick was to put clerks in line who were instructed to withdraw some gold and then simply return the coinage to the vault immediately afterward. This practice slowed down legitimate customers even further merely by making the lines longer.</p>\n<p>\n\tTwo hundred years later, a similar situation occurred in the U.S. as “bank runs” became commonplace during the Great Depression. Between 1929 and 1933, more than 43% (10,763 out of 24,970) of commercial banks in the country failed. Some banks, desperate to stay in business, resorted to ridiculous measures. One Utah bank instructed its tellers to work as slowly as possible, counting out small bills one by one, in order to reduce the pace at which money was being extracted by anxious account', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

It did so to ensure that exporters of watches and other goods and services wouldn\'t be at a disadvantage to their competitors in neighboring European countries.</p>\n<p>But this policy came to an end last Thursday, when the Swiss National Bank announced that it will no longer support the cap. In short order, the exchange rate of the franc proceeded to rise by almost 20% versus the euro.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To most people, a 20% increase in the value of an asset may not seem like an existential event. Individual stocks rise and fall by that degree all the time.</p>\n<p>But in the currency markets, a move like this is huge. So big that a number of foreign-exchange brokers were forced into insolvency. The largest in the United States would have failed on Friday, for example, but for a last-minute $300 million rescue package from the investment bank Jefferies Group.</p>\n<p>And it\'s not just foreign-exchange brokers that took a hit. According to multiple media sources, <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> and <strong>Citigroup</strong> suffered somewhere along the lines of $150 million in losses each, while <strong>Barclays</strong> racked up "tens of millions of dollars in losses."</p>\n<p>So here\'s the question: Why are financial firms so vulnerable to sudden fluctuations in currency values? Isn\'t this what foreign-exchange traders and risk managers on Wall Street get paid so much to navigate?</p>\n<p>While the answer to the second question is obviously "yes," understanding why financial firms get caught off guard so frequently (and fatally)\xa0is a bit more involved.</p>\n<p><strong>The role of extreme leverage<br /></strong>In the first case, because currencies are presumed to fluctuate less than, say, stocks do, currency traders rely on leverage to magnify the effect of otherwise small changes.</p>\n<p>"Currencies don\'t move that much," observed the CEO of <strong>FXCM </strong>(<a href="/quote/nasdaq/glbr/">GLBR</a>), the foreign-exchange broker that collapsed into the arms of Jefferies Group. "So if you had no leverage, nobody would trade."</p>\n<p>At FXCM, customers were allowed 50-to-1 leverage by default. This means that a person had to put up only 2% of the value of a trade to execute it; FXCM would finance the rest.</p>\n<p>So let\'s say you make a $1 million bet that the Swiss franc won\'t appreciate against the euro. At 50-to-1 leverage, that will cost you $20,000. If the franc depreciates by 1%, you\'ll earn $10,000, or 50% on your investment. Not bad! However, if the franc instead appreciates by, I don\'t know, say, 20%, then you\'re not only out your $20,000 investment, but you\'ll also have to cover the $180,000 loss incurred on your behalf by FXCM.</p>\n<p>This is what led to FXCM\'s current predicament. According to a <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1499912/000114420415002475/v398872_ex99-1.htm">press release</a> the firm issued on Thursday:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Because of] unprecedented volatility in EUR/CHF pair after the Swiss National Bank announcement this morning, clients experienced significant losses [and] generated negative equity balances owed to FXCM of approximately $225 million.</p>\n<p>As result of these debit balances, the company may be in breach of regulatory capital requirements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What went wrong here?

"When the money stops flowing down to the man on the street, the blood starts flowing in the streets."</p><p>Celente has long been a proponent of buying gold as a hedge against runaway inflation, which is a result of ongoing currency manipulation by the private and illegal Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve, a central bank which serves the interests of private bankers, has utilized fiat currency to manipulate the American money supply, and create the many economic "booms" and "busts" that have occurred over the years.</p><p>"The only mandate of the Federal Reserve is to keep the bankers in power and the people underneath them," said Celente during a recent interview with <i>Russia Today</i>. "They\'re devaluing the dollar and enslaving the people" (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXNqgk5XzA8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXNqgk5XzA8</a>).</p><p>When all is said and done, the ballooning crisis will ultimately culminate into World War III, which Celente and others have been predicting for years. This is why Celente also advocates storing food, firearms, and ammunition to protect your family from the terror that will result from widespread social unrest, which he believes will occur in the very near future.</p><p><b>Sources for this article include:</b></p><p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/stocks/story/\'">http://www.usatoday.com</a></p><p><a href="https://www.lewrockwell.com/slavo/slavo3">http://www.lewrockwell.com/slavo/slavo3".\'.html</a></p><p><a href="https://www.naturalnews.com/">https://www.naturalnews.com/"34566_\'"\'\'_predictions_Mayan_calendar.html</a></p></div><div>\n<div>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href="https://www.fetch.news/"></a></p>\n<p>Follow real-time breaking news headlines on <br /><b><a href="https://www.fetch.news/">Stock market</a></b> at FETCH.news</p>\n</div>\n</div><div>\n<p>\nReceive Our Free Email Newsletter\n</p>\n<p>Get independent news alerts on natural cures, food lab tests, cannabis medicine, science, robotics, drones, privacy and more.</p>\n</div><div>\n<h3>Take Action: Support Natural News by linking to this article from your website</h3>\n<p><b>Permalink to this article:</b><br />\n</p><p><b>Embed article link:</b> (copy HTML code below):<br />\n</p><p><b>Reprinting this article:</b>\n</p><p>Non-commercial use OK, cite NaturalNews.com with clickable link.\n</p', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

A tax break for commuters using public transit, for example, will grow by $20 per month to $300.</p>\n<p>But the current estate tax exemption is $12.06 million per person, so a 7 percent hike — $860,000 — is much bigger in that case. Married couples can use each other’s exemptions, and next year’s combined $1.72 million increase in the exclusion is larger than the entire estate tax exemption that was in place when George W. Bush became president.</p>\n<p>The tax is paid by a tiny share of people — only about 2,600 taxpayers owe the levy, IRS figures show. Three-fifths of the $18 billion it raises is paid by estates worth more than $50 million.</p>\n<p>The inflation increase comes despite a concerted though unsuccessful push by Democrats to hike taxes on the rich when they die. Arguing the wealthy were not paying their fair share, Democrats not only wanted to raise the estate tax, they pushed to eliminate related tax provisions that allow high-net-worth people to sidestep capital gains tax bills on assets they leave to heirs.</p>\n<p>Democrats will get another crack at the estate tax in the runup to 2026, when much of Republicans’ 2017 tax overhaul will expire. Republicans are pushing to extend the provisions.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, estate tax advisers say they are urging clients to act now to make use of the extra-large exemption — by giving money to children, for example.</p>\n<p>The IRS’s new inflation adjustments will allow people next year to give away, tax-free, up to $17,000 per person annually, without affecting their estate tax exclusion. That’s up $1,000 from this year. Gifts beyond that would reduce their exemption.</p>\n<p>So a couple with two children and five grandchildren can give them next year $238,000 annually without eating into their estate tax allowance.</p>\n<p>People are also free to give away the entire $25.8 million that’s now exempt from the estate tax while they’re still alive.</p>\n<p>Those sorts of gifts are common now among high-net-worth families — and not just because of the looming expiration of Republicans’ cut to the levy, said Brad Roe, an estate tax adviser at Grant Thornton.</p>\n<p>Prices for stocks and many other assets have been beaten down over the past year by the Federal Reserve as it raises interest rates in hopes of quashing inflation.

With inflation running near a 40-year high, experts say some major changes are likely to be in store for taxpayers.\xa0</p>\n \n<p>The IRS makes these changes to avoid "bracket creep" from the rising cost of living, noted American Enterprise Institute\'s Kyle Pomerleau, an expert on taxes. Without such adjustments, workers who received pay increases to keep up with inflation would be bumped into higher tax brackets, even though their standard of living remained the same.\xa0</p><p>This year, taxpayers could see some of the biggest changes in decades due to the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-hardship-56-percent-of-americans-gallup/">hottest inflation</a>\xa0since the early 1980s, tax experts say. While the IRS will likely officially announce these changes in October or November, the tax agency relies on a formula, based on inflation data, for calculating the new tax brackets and other limits. Based on that formula, Pomerleau <a href="https://www.aei.org/economics/higher-inflation-means-a-larger-adjustment-to-most-income-tax-provisions/">forecasts</a> that many tax provisions will be adjusted upwards by about 7%.\xa0</p><p>"This is something taxpayers can use to plan their taxes over the next year," Pomerleau noted. "So, next year taxpayers are going to set their withholding, businesses will make investment decisions, and that will depend on how much tax they have to pay."</p><p>Some taxpayers will be relying on the new inflation-adjusted provisions to make changes in the next several weeks, however. For instance, people who use flexible spending accounts to put aside money for medical expenses will need to make those decisions for 2023 in October or November of this year during open enrollment.</p><p>Taxpayers will also likely see a higher standard deduction in 2023, which could help lower their taxes. The standard deduction is an amount that taxpayers can use to reduce their taxable income, so a boost to this provision could conversely lower the amount of income earned by a worker that will be subject to tax next year.</p>\n \n<p>Workers should also consider whether they should invest more in their IRA or 401(k) accounts, given that it\'s likely the IRS will also make the contribution limits more generous to reflect this year\'s inflation, noted Eric Bronnenkant, head of tax at financial firm Betterment.\xa0</p><p>"The IRA threshold now is $6,000, so a lot of people have it set up so they put in $500 every month, and if they aren\'t thinking about it and here\'s an increase and they don\'t adjust upward, they could be missing out on a retirement plan benefit," he noted.\xa0</p><h2>New tax brackets for 2023</h2><p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/taxes-20', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

The aim of the proposal is to enable capital gain taxation of indirect real estate investments, which has not been possible under the current legislation.</p></section><section><p>If the proposal is accepted, it will allow the taxation of capital gains accrued by foreign investors who have invested in Finnish real estate indirectly via another company. When this foreign investor sells the entity that owns the Finnish property, the profit will be subject to Finnish capital gains tax. The capital gains tax will be imposed regardless of the length of the ownership chain and will also apply in situations where a foreign holding company, which indirectly owns Finnish real estate, is subject to sale.</p></section><section><p>However, the capital gains tax will be triggered only if more than 50% of the underlying assets of the sold entity consist of Finnish real estate on the date of sale or at any point during the 365 days before that date. The real estate includes any real estate properties as well as shares in housing companies and mutual real estate companies.</p></section><section><p>It is worth of noting that the new rules do not apply in all situations. Only half of the tax treaties Finland has concluded with other countries allow for the taxation of indirect real estate investments. The tax treaties signed with Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, the UK, and other Nordic countries, to mention a few, enable the taxation of capital gains arising from indirect real estate investments.</p></section><section><p>The remaining treaties that do not allow for the taxation of indirect real estate ownership include, for example, the tax treaties concluded with Luxemburg, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, Estonia, and Austria. Tax treaties may also impose other restrictions. For example, the Nordic Tax Treaty enables taxation only if more than 75% of the underlying assets consist of Finnish real estate.</p></section><section><p>The new rules will not be applied to foreign entities that can be considered comparable to Finnish tax-exempt entities. Furthermore, shares in entities that are listed on a stock exchange are exempted. As such, the proposal should be borne in mind when planning new real estate structures in Finland. Foreign investors located in countries whose tax treaties enable the taxation of indirect real estate investments should also prepare to be affected by the increased tax burden when disposing of their indirectly owned real estate assets in Finland.</p></section><section><figure><div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></section><section><p></p><h2>Exit tax for individuals</h2><p></p></section><section><p>The Finnish Ministry of Finance issued a draft government proposal for an exit tax for individuals on 12 August 2022. The proposed exit tax aims to extend Finland’s taxation right to encompass any increase in the assets’ value that has accrued while the individual in question has resided in Finland. The new exit tax will be triggered even if the assets are sold after the person has moved to another country.</p></section><section><p>The aforementioned exit tax would be applied to individuals with unlimited tax liability in Finland, whose country of residence, pursuant to the applicable tax treaty, has been Finland for at least four years during the ten years preceding the move to another country. This four-year period does not have to be one continuous period. The proposed regulation would cover movable assets such as shares, mutual fund units, bonds, and virtual currencies.</p></section><section><p>However, certain thresholds limit the application of the new exit tax.

The next test will come during tax season. Cryptocurrency forks, such as Bitcoin Cash (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-cash-price-index">BCH</a>), have created headaches for investors and accountants alike in the past.</p><p>While there has been progress, the United States Internal Revenue Service rules still weren’t ready for something like the Ethereum network upgrade. Nonetheless, there seems to be an interpretation of IRS rules that tax professionals and taxpayers can adopt to achieve simplicity and avoid unexpected tax bills.</p><h2>How Bitcoin Cash broke 2017 tax returns</h2><p>Because of a disagreement over block size, Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price">BTC</a>) forked in 2017. Everyone who held Bitcoin received an equal amount of the new forked currency, Bitcoin Cash. But <em>when</em> they received it, it caused some issues.</p><p>Bitcoin Cash was first issued in the fall but didn’t hit Coinbase or other major exchanges until December. By that time, it had gone up significantly in value. For tax purposes, receiving free coins is income. Suddenly, many investors had a lot of income to claim that they hadn’t anticipated.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/get-ready-for-a-swarm-of-incompetence-at-the-irs"><strong><em>Get ready for a swarm of incompetent IRS agents in 2023</em></strong></a></p><p>Many crypto-savvy accountants advised clients to claim the value of Bitcoin Cash when it was issued, not when it finally arrived in their exchange accounts. No IRS guideline explicitly said this was OK — in fact, it runs contrary to the accounting principle of dominion and control — but it seemed like the only reasonable way to handle the issue.</p><h2>Airdropped proof-of-work ETH is another gray area</h2><p>As a result of the problems with reporting income from Bitcoin Cash, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2019-24 to address the treatment of blockchain forks. According to the ruling, forks that result in the airdrop of a new currency to an existing holder are taxable accessions to wealth. While not the usage of “<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-a-crypto-airdrop-and-how-does-it-work">airdrop</a>” most investors are used to, the IRS uses the term to describe when the holder of an existing cryptocurrency receives a new currency from a fork.</p><p>The potential confusion with the Ethereum upgrade is that assigning the forked and original currency based on the ruling alone is unclear.

For a moment, it feels as though the wings have fallen off the plane. Out the window, I can see the wind tearing shreds of water off the heavy surf. I cinch up my seat belt and hold onto the seat for dear life. But the rest of the passengers seem unbothered. Across the aisle, even a one-year-old baby is completely serene sitting in its mother’s lap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My plane is landing at the Vágar airport in the Faroe Islands, and apparently, extreme weather is something even babies get used to here. The lesson is emphasized when I get off the plane—no jet bridge in an airport this small—and almost get bowled over by the wind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Faroes, a group of 18 islands in the North Atlantic about halfway between Norway and Iceland, are a peculiar place. They are part of the Kingdom of Denmark, but also semi-independent. All Faroese are Danish citizens and use the Danish krone as currency, but they have control over most other aspects of domestic and foreign policy. They are not part of the European Union, mostly run their own welfare state, and have negotiated separate fishing and trade treaties with neighboring countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://prospect.org/topics/ryan-cooper/"><strong><em>More from Ryan Cooper</em></strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I’m not primarily here to report on the blustery fall squalls, or the staggeringly beautiful scenery, or the abundance of sheep, or the cuisine (the fermented fish is worth trying), or even the local legend about seals that can turn into women—the reason why the tiny village of Mikladalur has a huge bronze statue of a naked woman on its beach.

Its operating principles are centralization, efficiency, and simplicity. It’s not the most riveting subject for a travel holiday, I’ll readily admit. But it’s beautiful in its own way—and it makes a major difference in the lives of every Faroese person, from the lowest worker to the owners of the biggest businesses. It’s hard to imagine fully implementing such a system in the United States, but we still might learn from their example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>THE FAROES ARE ONE OF THE RICHEST COUNTRIES</strong> in the world by per capita GDP—even slightly richer than Denmark itself. On first sight, this is rather hard to believe. The islands are 180 miles from the Shetland Islands on one side and 400 miles from Iceland on the other, with a population of just 54,000. It rarely gets that cold thanks to the warm Gulf Stream current, but it also doesn’t get that warm even in the brief summer.

(291, 'International Trade: International Trade Agreements', 'https://www.infoplease.com/business/trade/international-trade-international-trade-agreements', '<div><article>\n \n \n \n \n <h2>International Trade Agreements</h2> <p>Trade agreements regulate international trade between two or more nations. An agreement may cover all imports and exports, certain categories of goods, or a single category. The United States is currently engaged in some 320 trade agreements with various nations. (These are listed at <a href="http://www.tcc.mac.doc.gov/">www.tcc.mac.doc.gov</a>.) However, several general trade agreements have shaped trade policy on broad levels.</p> <p>The most important general trade agreement is called, simply enough, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). GATT was signed in October 1947 to liberalize trade, to create an organization to administer more liberal trade agreements, and to establish a mechanism for resolving trade disputes. The GATT organization is small and located in Geneva. More than 110 nations have signed the general agreement, which originally was signed by 24 nations, including the United States. To a large degree, the role of GATT as an organization has been superceded by the World Trade Organization, which I discuss later in this section.</p> <p>Since GATT was signed, several “rounds” of talks to liberalize trade have occurred. The most significant of these were the Kennedy rounds, which eventually led to a one-third reduction in tariffs and, more recently, the Uruguay rounds. The Uruguay rounds dealt with general barriers to trade and the relatively new issues of intellectual property rights, fishing practices, and environmental concerns.</p> <p>A major trend of the past 25 years has been the creation and growth of free trade zones among nations agreeing to form regional trade blocs. The agreements that create free trade zones all share the same aims: to liberalize trade, promote economic growth, and provide equal access to markets among the member nations.</p> <p>The most significant free trade zones are the European Union (EU), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p> <div> <h5>EconoTip</h5> <p>From time to time you will hear about so-called fast track trade legislation, in which Congress would give the president the authority to negotiate trade agreements. This legislation has not been passed, and it remains controversial.</p> <p>Supporters of the legislation believe that the present method of negotiating trade agreements, which requires Congressional approval, is too slow and cumbersome for today\'s world. Opponents point out that trade agreements are treaties with other nations and that the Constitution invests Congress with the authority to enter these agreements. They also point out that the fast track legislation would limit public debate on trade policy. That debate, of course, is one of the reasons that the present method is slow and cumbersome.</p></div> <p>In addition, the World Trade Organization (WTO) is a global organization, headquartered in Geneva, for dealing with trade between nations. Established in January 1995 by the Uruguay round negotiations under GATT, the WTO included 144 nations as of January 2002. The WTO administers trade agreements, provides a forum for trade negotiations and resolving trade disputes, monitors trade policies, and provides technical assistance and training for developing countries.</p> <h2>Let\'s Trade</h2> <p>Despite calls for protectionism from those who stand to lose from free trade, the world has clearly been liberalizing trade policy, lowering barriers to trade, and forming regional trade blocs. As a result, international trade is freer than it has ever been. We can all thank economists for this. They are without a doubt the steadiest, strongest, clearest voices in favor of free trade.</p> <p>U.S. tariffs stand at their lowest level in history. Before World War II they ranged up to 40 percent on some imports. Today, tariff revenues amount to less than 5 percent of import dollar volume, and many imports are exempt from tariffs and quotas. Nontariff barriers to trade have also been largely—but not completely—eliminated.</p> <p>This does not mean that all is rosy in the world of foreign trade, nor does it mean that the United States always plays fair in the global marketplace. U.S. agricultural subsidies and textile tariffs, for example, hinder imports of food, cloth, and clothing from poor nations in order to protect these domestic industries. Nevertheless, the United States and the world in general are expected to continue on the path toward freer international trade.</p> <div><p>Excerpted from <cite>The Complete Idiot\'s Guide to Economics</c', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

The devil’s in the details, and the fine print on some of these agreements is enough to curdle a bucket of blood.</p>\n<p>Whether it’s blocking a ban on chocolate-flavored cigarettes marketed to kids, or rolling back post-2008 regulations on Wall Street, these deals have a way of favoring corporations over people.

In response, proponents of the deals have attempted to slip under the radar by conducting negotiations in secret.</p>\n<p>Here are four of the scariest deals—and why they’re so abominable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The World Trade Organization, created in 1995 as a re-imagining of an earlier group called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is the mother of all trade bodies and sets the rules for the flow of goods and services between countries. The WTO claims its goal is to “improve the welfare of the peoples of the member countries.” But critics say what it really does is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jul/29/wto-doha-fails-poorest-countries">force poor nations to open their markets to wealthier ones</a>, who themselves often bend the WTO’s rules.</p>\n<p>The WTO also gives companies a place to complain about regulations enacted by democratically elected governments. It has found fault with laws protecting public health, the environment, workers’ rights, and other things that would affect industries’ bottom line. Recent rulings have objected to producers labeling certain kinds of tuna as “dolphin safe;” the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s ban on sweet-flavored cigarettes that entice kids; and labels that inform consumers what country meat products originated in. The WTO says such labels violate the rights of Mexican and Canadian farmers to a level playing field. The United States sometimes refuses to comply—but risks trade sanctions when it does so.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most frightening of all, the WTO (along with NAFTA) has spawned a whole new brood of bilateral and regional deals that take the same approach to trade and development.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, if approved, would promote trade between the United States and the European Union.</p>\n<p>The deal has some bright spots—for example, it would universalize the plugs for electric cars.

In the early nineteenth century, British economist David Ricardo explained all of this, and his ideas about <strong>comparative advantage</strong> continue to guide our thinking about international trade.</p><p>But the web of free trade Ricardo envisioned would not have been possible without the international currency agreements that facilitate commercial exchange. In the last decades of the nineteenth century, many commercial powers, including the United States, adopted an international <strong>gold standard</strong>—they agreed to back their currencies with gold and fix the rate of exchange. But the gold standard would not last forever; countries began to abandon the gold standard during the Great Depression. For a time, the US dollar replaced gold as the backbone of international commerce, but today currencies float freely—that is, their value relative to one another is shaped by supply and demand.</p><p>Governments work to protect the value of their currency so that their goods will trade easily. Many also work to protect their domestically produced goods from excessive foreign competition. <strong>Protectionist</strong> tools, such as <strong>quotas</strong> and <strong>tariffs</strong>, restrict imports and protect domestic industries and the jobs they provide. But many argue that protectionism undermines the benefits of <strong>free trade</strong>. The unrestricted flow of international goods inspires efficiency and innovation in the workplace, and ensures lower prices in the marketplace.</p><h4>Why Should I Care?</h4>\n <p>What would happen if the United States didn't trade with other nations?

But after 1945, most leaders around the world converged on support for freer trade. Taken by the idea that more open markets promote innovation, competition and growth, they pursued them, first in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (<small>GATT</small>), founded in 1948, and then after the <small>GATT</small> was transformed into the World Trade Organisation (<small>WTO</small>) in 1995.</p><p>The <small>WTO</small> was an extraordinary achievement. For the first time—and almost uniquely for international institutions—the system included binding dispute settlement, so that victims of rule-breaking could win redress. No longer could big countries throw their weight around and assume that any injury to others was consequence-free. Such was the faith placed in the new institution that, when China belatedly joined it in 2001, many in the West hoped that it would lead to economic and political convergence with rich democracies.</p><p>Exceptions were permitted within the rules-based system, but they were carefully policed. One for national security was invoked sparingly, as everybody saw it could too easily be abused. Environmental protection was allowed as a justification for some trade restrictions, but no more than was absolutely necessary. Labour lobbyists complaining of unfair competition were denounced as protectionist by those who saw cost differentials as legitimate forms of comparative advantage. Indeed, economic integration was seen as a way to help achieve these other goals. Not only would economies benefit from being bound together, but faster growth would mean higher environmental and labour standards.</p><p>All this translated into generally lower tariffs. Between 1990 and 2017 the trade-weighted average global tariff applied under <small>WTO</small> rules fell by 4.2 percentage points. The drop was greatest in poorer countries: in the same period China’s tariffs fell by 28 points, India’s by 51 and Brazil’s by 10. It also prompted a push for bilateral and regional trade deals, which expanded from around 50 in the early 1990s to as many as 300 in 2019. These have cut trade-weighted applied tariffs by a further 2.3 percentage points.</p><p>This system supported an explosion of global trade as a share of gross output, from around 30% in the early 1970s to 60% in the early 2010s. Over the same period complex global supply chains grew from around 37% to 50% of total trade. The stunning collapse in transport costs boosted international commerce. But so did stability. After China joined the <small>WTO</small>, one study by Kyle Handley of the University of California, San Diego, and Nuno Limão of the University of Maryland found that reduction in uncertainty was responsible for around a third of the growth in Chinese exports between 2000 and 2005.</p><p>As those early campaigners predicted, freer trade has brought higher living standards. A report by the World Bank in 2019 concluded that a 1% rise in participation in global value chains is linked with an increase in income per head of more than 1% in the long run. A survey of the literature by Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College found that poor countries which liberalised trade enjoyed higher growth of 1-1.5 percentage points, cumulating to 10-20% after a decade.

It does not make easy reading for the supporters of global free trade: it wishes to see universal tariffs introduced on US imports and a virtual end to trade with China by 2029.\xa0 At the same time Republicans in the House of Representative propose a bill to ban the Chinese social media app Tik Tok. Meanwhile the EU mulls vast subsidies to industry to compete with the US in green technology. In the UK the Truss idea of rolling trade deals has turned to dust. Where did it all go wrong for the free traders? The turning point was 2016, the year the free trade dream began to die.</p>\n<p>In the heart of a certain type of Brexiteer, leaving the EU was the key to Britain returning to its free trading nineteenth century roots. Free of the dead hand of Brussels, the UK would set sail across the world and sign trade deals here, there, and everywhere. The USA? Yes. India? Definitely. China? Why not? Of course, as with most utopian projects, this did not happen. There is a (bad) trade deal with Australia, trade deals rolled over from our EU membership and an Indian trade deal that never seems to quite happen.</p>\n<p>The first step to the collapse in the free trade order was the Brexit referendum, which led to the severing of the European Single Market into the UK and the rest of Europe. The next step — and the one with the most global significance — was the election of Donald Trump as the 45<sup>th</sup> President of the United States in November 2016.</p>\n<p>Trump’s first act as President was to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a trade deal that would have covered 40% of the world’s GDP. This deal has continued as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, but without the giant US economy, it is rather like the EU without Germany. The horrible truth is there are not that many New Zealanders that Vietnam can sell cheap manufactured goods to. The fact that Bernie Sanders and Trump had both attacked this deal early in 2016 showed the protectionist turn US politics was taking.</p>\n<p>The true nature of this shift is reflected in the Biden administration ruling out any new trade deals, maintaining the Trump tariffs on China and continuing the Trump era policy of blocking nominations to the appellate court of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). This obscure technical move has huge implications, as without a functioning appellate court the WTO cannot enforce any rulings. For example, the WTO ruled against American tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from China in December 2022. But the USA can appeal the ruling to the appellate court and as this court can’t sit due to American actions, the WTO can’t authorise other countries to respond to the American tariffs. This is true of any other country who now wishes to impose trade limitations. The WTO’s role as a trade referee has just collapsed.</p>\n<p>The Chinese have set a path for world trade that others are now following. They saw trade as a means to an end, nothing else. They used the world’s openness — notably their accession to the WTO in 2000 — to become an export powerhouse, growing their economy at a breakneck pace. This went hand in hand with exploiting the greed of Western multinationals, desperate to access the growing Chinese market. China would let certain Western firms in, on their terms, extracting their technology expertise in the process. The firms they let in, such as Apple, contributed directly to China by building the iPhones they sold to Chinese consumers in China, paying Chinese workers. The Chinese were too sensible to ever let American social media into their market. The various half-cocked attempts by Western governments to limit or ban Tik Tok shows that they are following the Chinese approach and that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.</p>\n<p>The truth is that China and the USA both have such vast home markets that the global trading system is an optional extra that can be sacrificed in their battle to be the dominant global power of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Every other major economy or trading bloc, even the EU, will be helpless bystanders, caught in the trade war crossfire, forced to take protectionist measures to protect their economies and firms. This is not surprising to anyone familiar with history. Those Brexiteers who wished to return to the nineteenth century liberal free trade should have remembered that Britain ultimately sacrificed free trade and even the Empire to stop German hegemony in Europe.

Despite this, the number of protectionist policies enacted around the world has increased.</p>\n<p>This is due to a rising tendency to view trade as a competition, rather than a cooperative endeavor. For evidence, consider the ongoing China-U.S. trade war, which has impacted everything from electronics to soybeans.</p>\n<p>The economic costs of this dispute are well-documented. In 2019, Moody’s Analytics found that the trade war had cost America 300,000 jobs. In 2020, the Federal Reserve concluded that U.S. firms had lost <strong>$1.7 trillion</strong> in market capitalization due to the introduction of new tariffs.</p>\n<p>In this infographic from the <a href="http://bit.ly/3hBIvba">Hinrich Foundation</a>—the first of a three-part series on global trade—we explain the theory behind free trade and explore a powerful dataset that disproves the rationale for protectionist policies.</p>\n<h2>Why Do We Trade?</h2>\n<p>The main reason countries trade is to <strong>specialize their production</strong>. This is when a country’s population is able to focus on what it does best. For example, consider Germany’s expertise in automobiles, or America’s <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-tech-giants-worth-compared-economies-countries/">leadership in tech</a>.</p>\n<p>These countries use their comparative advantages to generate a greater surplus than if they produced all of their needs on their own. Through exchange, they can trade their surplus output (exports) for the output of others (imports).</p>\n<p>Imports are what facilitate the benefits of trade. These are goods that people consume without having to produce, and they can help reduce costs, <a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2013/04/does-import-competition-improve-the-quality-of-domestic-goods/">catalyze greater competition</a>, and even spark innovation.</p>\n<h2>A New Era of Deglobalization</h2>\n<p>Between 2001 and 2008, trade grew immensely.

Global trade <a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/ditcinf2022d1_en.pdf">hit</a> a record $28.5 trillion last year with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/globalization-isnt-dead-its-just-not-american-anymore/2022/05/06/d36f8908-cda1-11ec-b7ee-74f09d827ca6_story.html">projections</a> to grow in 2023. The pace, however, is expected to slow. The reason for this is less a problem with globalization itself and more the historic setbacks that globalism has faced.</p>\n<p>Before continuing, it is important to define some terms. Globalization occurs when societies around the world begin to interact and integrate economically and politically. The intercontinental trade experienced during the Age of Sail and via the Silk Road are early examples of globalization. Globalization really took off after World War II and received a recent boost with the widespread adoption of the internet. Importantly, globalization in common discourse includes both the voluntary economic activities between peoples of different nations and the involuntary geopolitical activities of governments.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Ian Bremmer <a href="https://archive.vn/RCK68">defines</a> globalism as an ideology that calls for top-down trade liberalization and global integration backed by a unipolar power. Statists believe that market exchange between people is literally impossible without government; only when a group claims a legal monopoly on violence and then builds infrastructure, provides security, documents property titles, and serves as the final arbiter of disputes can a market come into existence. Globalism is the application of this perspective to international trade. Globalists believe that top-down global governance enforced and secured by a unipolar superpower enables globalization.</p>\n<p>But, like statists on a more local scale, the globalist view is logically and historically flawed. Global trade was well underway before the first major attempt at global governance, the League of Nations, in 1919. The league’s stated aim was to ensure peace and justice for all nations of the world through collective security. Falling apart at the outset of World War II, it failed miserably. But globalism as an ideology found its footing after the war. Europe was devastated. This left the US and the USSR as the only two countries with the ability to exert power globally.</p>\n<p>So began the fastest era of globalization in history. Trade exploded as people moved on from the war. The globalist project also got off the ground with the founding of the United Nations and the World Bank. Globalism was limited only by the ideological differences between the two superpowers. The USSR wanted to <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm">support</a> revolutions while the US aimed for top-down trade liberalization—which drove the recent allies apart and plunged the world into the Cold War.</p>\n<p>In the United States, the neoliberals and neoconservatives dominated the political mainstream through their shared mission to bring markets and democracy to the world at gunpoint and financed by US taxpayers.

This was the white whale for decades. It was <em>technically</em> possible but would have been extremely burdensome for community banks, because it is (fundamentally) a call to subsidize some depositors at the expense of others. That subsidy would have been bearable for the largest, most broadly distributed financial institutions in the world, but would have covered almost the entire deposit base of many community institutions. The tough part about subsidies is that someone has to pay for them. As we discussed previously, <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/community-banking-and-fintech/">community banks exercise quite a bit of influence in the U.S.</a>, and so proposals for "free banking" got quietly killed.</p><p>So it would probably surprise advocates, burned from this discussion in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, that in 2021 the U.S. has nationally distributed free banking offerings that users love, that are profitable for the industry, and that do not stem from a regulatory mandate.</p><p>The key driver of the change has been competition for the deposit business of regular households. It\'s a fascinating story.</p><p>Perhaps some readers may not remember this, but prior to the mid-1990s checking accounts had price tags. In the 1990s, “free checking” became a marketing phenomenon, partly aimed at growing the number of banked households but mainly a pricing war between a consolidating industry hunting for share in local markets.</p><p><em>Free checking wasn’t free</em>. Instead of most depositors paying a predictable (and relatively small) fee for their checking account, a tiny portion of the depositor base was assessed many, many $25-$35 fees stochastically based on how frequently their incomings and outgoings were temporarily mismatched. This resulted in a perverse tax-the-poorest-harder situation, where more than $10 billion annually was collected, with the <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201306_cfpb_whitepaper_overdraft-practices.pdf">large majority of it coming from less than 10% of banked households</a> [PDF].

Truth be told, I wish there were more juicy details on what their edge in markets is, but it’s wishful thinking given the secrecy of the field in general and Renaissance in particular.</p><p>Instead of my usual <a href="https://medium.com/@neoyipeng">articles</a> where I implement machine learning models, I decided to pen my learning points from the book, so whoever wants to skip the Mercer-funding-Trump drama and the side effects of ultra-rich employees can still learn the precious nuggets of how the Medallion fund achieved 66.1% average annual returns since 1988.</p><h2>Insights from The Man Who Solved The Market</h2><p><strong>1. Financial knowledge is optional — </strong>A big difference between Renaissance and other quant funds is that their team consists of scientists, not Wall Street folks. With zero finance background, they treat financial data like the scientific/text data they used to experiment on. An embarrassingly funny scene happened when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mercer">Bob Mercer</a> was asked how they made so much money with their models. He replied that “<em>sometimes it tells us to buy Chrysler, sometimes it tells us to sell.” </em>This was when Chrysler was no longer trading after having been acquired — it shows how little Renaissance needs to know about the underlying fundamentals of the companies, even their names!</p><p><strong>2. Rationalising the model’s predictions is not top priority</strong>\u200a—\u200aAnother possible side effect of hiring researchers and not economists was that they care more about how statistically significant the trading anomalies are than how explainable they can be. As such, they dare to trade non-intuitive anomalies that are hard to explain/understand. I like this because often times with deep learning and models, it can be hard to rationalise our model’s predictions. One disadvantage is that it will be hard to know when to stop trading the idea. For example, an anomaly exists due to government restrictions, when the story no longer holds, we can stop the trade. Without the story, we have to rely on statistical tests to confirm that a signal no longer exists.</p><p><strong>3. Research papers are likely wrong — </strong>In a bid to find ideas, Simons started a book club to read and discuss papers that claimed to have found alpha. Sadly, when they tried to backtest the papers, they never worked. If the researchers had really found alpha, they probably wouldn’t have published them in the first place, but I do find reading papers a source of inspiration/ideas.</p><p><strong>4. Have a single trading model</strong> — Instead of creating a unique trading model for every asset class, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Laufer">Henry Laufer</a> felt that one big model for all asset classes would let them leverage the huge swathes of data they had collected and model correlations between different asset classes. This allows future ideas to be added on easily as the model already has an implicit understanding of markets and prices moved. Even for asset classes with smaller history, they could be traded if they were similar to investments with richer history. This reminds me of transfer learning in neural networks, where you first train a generic model to learn a good representation of a huge image/text dataset, after which you can append any downstream task with great success. This works better than having one model for one downstream task, where you usually don’t have that much labelled data and this restricts the model’s capacity to learn.</p><p><strong>5.

He didn't want to carry the bundle home because he knew he'd be back in Ur again to buy grain at the end of harvest season. Instead the merchant walked to the local temple, where valuables were often stored, and asked the priest to hold onto the silver for him.</p>\n<p>Shortly after, the priest's nephew showed up to ask for a loan. The young man wanted to buy seed to grow his own crops, a wish that tugged at his uncle's heartstrings. So the priest loaned him some of the silver, reasoning that if his nephew failed to repay him by the time the merchant needed the silver back, he could fill in the missing amount with his personal funds or borrow it from friends. By using a long-term contract with the foreign merchant to support a short-term loan to his nephew, the priest doubled the number of commercial transactions by using the same money twice. In other words, he invented fractional banking.</p>\n<p>Based on archaeological evidence, we know that some scenario like this one occurred in Mesopotamia, and it profoundly changed the financial environment in two ways. First, it increased the overall productivity of the economy, because the nephew could now afford seed. Second, it introduced risk: the nephew might not be able to pay the money back in time.</p><figure></figure>\n<p>A few millennia later the emergence of government-backed central banks in 17th-century Europe connected this “double spending” with taxation. The king would borrow money from merchants to fight wars or build roads, and he would use it to pay arms manufacturers, purveyors and troops. That money began circulating, generating economic activity and profits, and at each step the amount of money was doubled—or more. The king typically repaid the loans with taxes imposed on profits, launching a prototype monetary circuit that marks the beginning of the banking system we use today.</p>\n<p>Distilled to its simplest form, the modern circuit works along these lines: First, firms borrow money from private banks like JPMorgan Chase or HSBC to pay workers' salaries and other expenses. This is the step where money is created. Second, consumers purchase goods produced by firms or deposit the money as savings in banks. Finally, those firms use the money they receive to repay banks, and the cycle is complete. At this stage, the originally lent money is destroyed, but the interest stays in the system forever. That's how private banks can jump-start economies by creating money “out of thin air.” Their power to do so is regulated in part by central banks, which impose limits on the amount of capital and liquidity private banks must always have to back lending activities.</p>\n<p>If only it were so simple. Unfortunately, the monetary circuit introduces some fundamental problems into society. For one thing, it inevitably creates a handful of billionaires who control a high concentration of total wealth. It is also distressingly common to see leveraged money creation without sufficient understanding of (or care for) the risks. Which is how we get financial crashes, such as the one in 2008: when bankers and politicians spurred an insatiable demand for mortgages, it was met by a significant increase in the amount of money created—along with an even more significant increase in risk.</p>\n<p>It may seem obvious to blame the monetary circuit itself for these problems. But it's not the root of the issue. Leveraged money creation works well as long as we can understand and control its inherent risks while suppressing undesirable wealth concentration. Today, however, a tangled web of factors, such as a booming population, global trade and powerful computers, makes the system far too complicated to manage and regulate, let alone understand.</p>\n<p>What's more troubling is that the prevailing framework we use to guide macroeconomic activity is based on outdated paradigms. Models that are typically used to govern money creation and interest rates, for example, still treat private banks as simple intermediaries, ignoring the fact that they are big, active, money-creating elements unto themselves. That banks have their own motivations and profit-making strategies injects major opacity into the system. It's no wonder that the 2008 mortgage crisis was difficult to see coming.</p><figure></figure>\n<p>Today's supercomplex monetary circuit needs to be modeled in unprecedented detail for us to actually understand it.

That is perhaps unsurprising, because they are generally bizarre. Fire a beam of electrons through two slits onto a screen and they will pass through both at once, travelling as a wave but arriving as particles. Concentrate enough energy in a region of space, and matter and antimatter pop out of the void. Introduce the right two particles to each other and they pop back into it.</p><p>All this seems worlds away from the mundane reality of traders tapping out buy and sell orders on their keyboards. But on a closer look finance bears a striking resemblance to the quantum world. A beam of light might seem continuous, but is in fact a stream of discrete packets of energy called photons. Cash flows come in similarly distinct chunks. Like the position of a particle, the true price of an asset is unknowable without making a measurement—a transaction—that in turn changes it. In both fields uncertainty, or risk, is best understood not as a peripheral source of error, but as the fundamental feature of the system.</p><p>Such similarities have spawned a niche area of research known as quantum finance. In a forthcoming book, “Money, Magic, and How to Dismantle a Financial Bomb”, David Orrell, one of its leading proponents, surveys the landscape. Mr Orrell argues that modelling markets with the mathematical toolbox of quantum mechanics could lead to a better understanding of them.</p><p>Classical financial models are rooted in the mathematical idea of the random walk. They start by dividing time into a series of steps, then imagine that at each step the value of a risky asset like a stock can go up or down by a small amount. Each jump is assigned a probability. After many steps, the probability distribution for the asset’s price looks like a bell curve centred on a point determined by the cumulative relative probabilities of the moves up and the moves down.</p><p>A quantum walk works differently. Rather than going up or down at each step, the asset’s price evolves as a “superposition” of the two possibilities, never nailed down unless measured in a transaction. At each step, the various possible paths interfere like waves, sometimes amplifying each other and sometimes cancelling out. This interference creates a very different probability distribution for the asset’s final price to that generated by the classical model. The bell curve is replaced by a series of peaks and troughs.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the classical random walk is a better description of how asset prices move. But the quantum walk better explains how investors think about their movements when buying call options, which confer the right to buy an asset at a given “strike” price on a future date. A call option is generally much cheaper than its underlying asset, but gives a big pay-off if the asset’s price jumps. The scenarios foremost in the buyer’s mind are not a gentle drift in the price but a large move up (from which they want to benefit) or a big drop (to which they want to limit their exposure).</p><p>The potential return is particularly juicy for options with strikes much higher than the prevailing price. Yet investors are much more likely to buy those with strikes close to the asset’s market price.', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

We are among the top developers in the FinTech industry that solely focus on developing technology solutions for the banking and financial industry.</p>\n </blockquote>\n \n \n \n <p>Fintech landscape is evolving at a rapid pace. Each passing day brings a radical change in the financial technology (FinTech) industry. The advent of new technologies paves the way for a new world where all the financial operations will take place online. Numerous technology implementations that happened in 2020 and 2021 will continue to be seen. But,<a href="https://www.articlesfactory.com/submit.html"></a> there are some new FinTech trends that we’re expecting to witness in 2021.</p> \n<p>We have already started experiencing many of the FinTech transformations on a daily basis, like when we make payments via\xa0<a href="https://www.nimbleappgenie.com/blogs/e-wallets-2020-trend-types-and-challenges/">eWallets</a>, buy equities via\xa0<a href="https://www.nimbleappgenie.com/blogs/stock-trading-app-development-cost-estimation-with-advanced-features/">stock trading apps</a>, apply for a mortgage, and so on.

Only a few industries have seen an upward trend, and banking and finance technology is one of them.\xa0</p> \n<p>The fintech market saw a considerable upsurge during the pandemic. Both customers and businesses started realizing the importance of contactless payments. According to new research by\xa0deVere Group, FinTech apps in Europe have seen a massive rise of 72% due to the pandemic.</p> \n<p>The situation is quite similar in the United States. According to a\xa0survey by Plaid, 69% of Americans found FinTech apps as a lifeline during the pandemic. Furthermore, 73% of the US population states that FinTech is the new normal, and they plan to keep using FinTech apps even after the pandemic ends.</p> \n<p>FinTech apps and solutions have indeed received an overwhelming response during the pandemic.

It’s what’s made much of stock trading commission-free, which in turn brought into the markets the millions of new retail investors who fueled 2021’s so-called meme stock revolution. But PFOF has also become a focus of attention for the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which after months of deliberations, decided not to ban the practice but to develop other changes that could make the practice less profitable.</p></div><p>1. What is payment for order flow?\xa0</p><p>It’s money paid to brokerages for the right to execute orders coming from the brokerage’s retail investors. The firms making the payments are electronic wholesalers, also known as market makers, and include such giants as Citadel Securities, Virtu Financial and Susquehanna International Group. Between them, Citadel and Virtu handle more than half of the wholesale trading market; Citadel alone handles one in every four US equities trades. The payment recipients are retail brokers that range from newcomers like Robinhood Markets Inc. to veterans like E*Trade and Charles Schwab Corp. The payments are allowed if the market makers and brokerages are providing brokerage clients with what regulators consider “best execution” on trades, a standard based on a combination of price, speed and other factors.</p><p>2. Why are they willing to pay for order flow?\xa0</p><p>Market makers have spent billions of dollars on sophisticated technology that lets them execute trades involving billions of shares per day. The top six such firms executed roughly $58 billion worth of share orders in March 2022, according to Bloomberg data. These firms make money by paying a little less to buy a stock, or by getting a little more when they sell a stock from retail orders. This small “spread” is essentially part of the price retail investors pay. These tiny profits on smaller orders add up, making it worth paying retail brokerages to have trades sent their way.\xa0</p><p>3. Why the focus on retail trades?</p><p>Institutional orders are larger, can shift the price of a stock dramatically -- exposing the market makers to greater risks if the price swings against them -- and take longer to execute. Retail trades are smaller, so they have less of an impact on price, and can happen in a matter of milliseconds.\xa0</p><p>4. How big is payment for order flow?</p><p>Total payments for order flow in the first quarter of 2022 came to $840 million for both equities and options trades, and $3.8 billion for all of 2021. The number of trades steered to retail wholesalers for equities this way could represent as much as 14% of stock activity, but has varied over recent months depending on the market’s conditions.\xa0</p><p>5. How has this changed stock trading?</p><p>Payment for order flow helped to usher in the no-fee trading era. It gave Robinhood, the upstart financial-technology company, a reliable source of revenue that let it knock its price to trade down to zero, compared with a previous average price of $4.99 per trade. That pushed most of its competitors to follow suit in 2019. Retail trading took off during the pandemic disruptions of early 2020, with people making more investments while stuck at home. That enthusiasm has worn off. Average daily volume of the six larger wholesalers is down 47% from the January 2021 peak. Still, the momentum contributed to the migration of trades happening away from public exchanges.</p><p>6. Where did trading move?\xa0</p><p>There’s been a steady increase in what’s known as off-exchange trading, which has grown from 11% of trading volume in 2004 to 40% in May 2022. Off-exchange trading, which includes alternative trading systems or dark pools, doesn’t display the investor’s asking or offer price, which is information that can drive stock prices up or down, potentially reducing profits.

New start-ups like Harvest.io are making waves by leveraging new technologies to disrupt one the largest and oldest sectors of finance.</p>\n<p>In what feels like an infinite universe of thematic funds and obscure financial products, the biggest trend in 2020 is the record highs that the money market exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reached, exceeding $4.6 trillion USD—-all thanks to the power of AI and automation. ETFs are funds that have strict mandates that require them to maintain precise allocations of their capital across a range of predefined products. As the market prices the assets move, the ETF must rebalance allocations to remain within their mandates. This gets particularly tricky when the ETF capital amounts are varying widely from day to day. This is where AI and automation enables these funds to process thousands of transactions a day and actively rebalance as the market moves. This allows them to meet their mandate and manage large pools of capital at scale.</p>\n<p>Money market ETFs provide safety to investors to preserve their capital in turbulent markets while still generating modest returns. It should be no surprise that as the pandemic loomed, global investors looked to derisk their portfolios and opted for money market ETFs to weather the economic uncertainty. In a similar spirit, many investors also opted to buy digital assets like Bitcoin which many experts believe functions as a hedge against possible inflation due to its hardcoded fixed supply.</p>\n<p>It is here, at the intersection of AI, automation, and digital assets we find what has become the biggest trend in finance of 2020 — Automated money markets for digital assets.

(Congress did not bar us from getting stimulus cheques, though the Internal Revenue Service tried to.) That windfall came as a total shock. When Nick first heard prisoners might be eligible to get the money, he laughed in disbelief. “After 20 years of listening to rumour after rumour in prison, one thing I know is that the ones with good news are almost never true. This time I was wrong,” Nick said.

With rates still high this year, while stocks have rebounded, the top 100 funds ended July in the black with $104 in assets for every $1 in future liabilities, according to Milliman’s numbers.</p> <p>Insurance giant <a href="https://pensionrisktracker.aon.com/">Aon puts the figure at $102</a>.\xa0</p> <p>Since late 2021, the average discount rate used by these funds to calculate the value of future obligations has nearly doubled, from 2.73% to 5.25%.</p> <p>“Over the last 12 months (August 2022–July 2023), the cumulative asset return for these plans has been 1.6%, and yet the Milliman 100 PFI funded status deficit has improved by $43 billion,” <a href="https://us.milliman.com/en/insight/pension-funding-index-august-2023">Milliman reports</a>. “This funded status gain is primarily the result of significant increases in discount rates over the past 12-month period. Discount rates increased by 100 bps to 5.25% from 4.25% one year ago.”</p> <p>This leaves pensions on average in their best financial shape since just before the last two financial crashes, in 2007 and the early 2000s. And it also leaves them vulnerable to any fall in interest rates.</p> <p>In the private sector, defined-benefit plans such as these are holdovers from a bygone age. Such traditional pension plans pay retirees an income for life based upon their salary and years of service. The corporation which manages the fund bears the investment risk, whereas in modern defined-contribution plans – such as 401(k)s – the risks are\xa0borne\xa0by the employee. The top 100 corporate plans now hold $1.35 trillion in assets, according to Milliman.</p> <p>Defined-contribution plans, by contrast, hold $9.8 trillion — or more than seven times as much.</p> <p>Traditional “defined-benefit” plans remain the norm in state and local governments, where they hold an estimated $5.3 trillion in assets and have 27 million active and retired members.

U.K. inflation was 10.5% at year-end, giving a real return of about -31%.</p>\n<p>However, put in the context of pension funding and calculating the "comparable return" of liabilities over the year — at -35% — U.K. funds in aggregate ended the year about £400 billion ($488.7 billion) better off, said Simeon Willis, CIO at XPS in London.</p>\n<p>The horrors of the fall\'s liquidity crisis remain a theme for 2023, with two of his "things to watch" this year relating directly to that period.</p>\n<p>One is potential new regulations around the management of LDI, to cover issues including the use of leverage and operational procedures. Based on findings by the House of Lords\' industry and regulators committee, published Feb. 7, "this is potentially far-reaching involving action from regulators, trustees, fund managers and consultants," he said.</p>\n<p>The second thing to watch is the selling of illiquid private markets assets at "distressed prices," as pension funds continue work to increase the amount of liquid assets in their portfolios to support LDI hedging programs. However, "this has created an opportunity for schemes to buy at a cheap price where they have the ability to hold illiquid assets," Mr. Willis added.</p>\n<p>Pension risk transfer is also on the agenda, with many U.K. pension funds finding themselves in a better funding position than a year ago, said Charles Cowling, chief actuary at <a href="https://researchcenter.pionline.com/rankings/consultant/profiles/34003/overview">Mercer</a> in Manchester, England.</p>\n<p>Data from the Pension Protection Fund\'s 7800 index show funding ratios at 136.5% as of Dec. 31, vs. 107.7% at the end of 2021. Funding ratios dipped slightly in January 2023, to 134.8%. The PPF is the lifeboat fund for pension plans of insolvent U.K. companies.</p>\n<p>However, capacity at the insurers — both human and capital — will be a focus, and moving to buyout is "a huge amount of work — if you fully settle your liabilities, you have got to get your data absolutely agreed between you and an insurance company," Mr. Cowling added. He said the value of liabilities transacted this year could be anywhere from £50 billion to £100 billion.</p>\n<p>Another big question going forward is what happens to inflation and interest rates in the U.K. "If you look at what\'s baked in, (market consensus expects) interest rates to peak, at about 4.5%, and projections suggesting inflation will come down to the magic 2% pretty quickly," added James Brundrett, London-based partner and senior investment consultant at Mercer. "Is that going to happen, and how big a recession are we going to have? In the U.S., consensus is it\'s going to be a soft landing — but the U.K. has got its own challenges and inflation is coming down more slowly," Mr. Brundrett said.</p>\n</div></div>', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

(319, 'How to Make Financial News Work For You', 'https://www.morningstar.com/financial-advice/why-read-financial-news', '<div><div><h2>Looking Backwards</h2><p>Most investment research recommends what <i>did </i>work. Consider, for example, the wave of 2022 articles that touted inflation hedges. A typical case was this <a href="https://www.moneycrashers.com/best-inflation-hedges/">May 2022 article</a>, which featured eight potential investments. Six appear below. (The other two suggestions, exchange-traded funds and mutual funds, were too vague to analyze.)</p><p>1) Precious Metals</p><p>2) Commodities</p><p>3) Stocks</p><p>4) Real Estate</p><p>5) TIPS</p><p>6) Cryptocurrencies</p><p>(Stocks were something of an odd choice, in that a) they had fallen during early 2022 precisely because of inflation, and b) they were mainstream investments. Buying more equities would not have improved portfolio diversification. However, their inclusion was valid: Over time, most stocks do ward off inflation, because companies pass their increased costs along to their customers as price hikes.)</p><p>The article’s timing was less than ideal. Since that article was published, the only one of those assets to outpace inflation was the item that most investors already owned: U.S. equities. Everything else either lost money outright, or in bitcoin’s case, eked out a tiny gain but nevertheless lost ground to inflation.</p><h2>What the People Want</h2><p>I point no fingers. My purpose in citing this article was not to identify bad journalism. The author’s recommendations were generally sound, written in response to what were logical fears.</p><p>Besides, the author had merely given readers what they wished. At the time, investors eagerly sought advice about how to invest during high inflation. Which leads to a key point: Financial news does not usually err because journalists advance their own agendas. The problem stems instead from giving investors <i>what they want.</i> People watch train wrecks. They devour true-crime stores. And they wish to read about investment dangers.</p><p>The problem with that mindset, of course, is that, as Yogi Berra once stated, it’s tough to make predictions, particularly about the future. To cite another sage, Paul Samuelson famously quipped that “Economists have predicted nine of the past five recessions.” He was too kind; a more accurate ratio would be 10 of the past three. Anticipating pitfalls before they arrive is an extremely valuable skill. Unfortunately, as evidenced by the poor results of <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/funds/have-tactical-asset-allocation-funds-earned-their-keep">tactical asset allocation funds</a>, the track record of those who have attempted that task is woeful.</p><p>What mostly remains, then, are discussions of events that have already happened: rising inflation, regional-bank woes, political battles. Unfortunately, as we have seen, such research has limited value. It is not that those articles are consistently wrong. If so, they would be helpful, because investors could profit by betting against the grain. Rather, their outcomes are random. Sometimes, as with 2021′s features on inflation or this spring’s Silicon Valley Bank seizure, the signals occur early enough to be constructive. Other times, they do not.</p><h2>The Counterargument</h2><p>Writing this column has thus far depressed me. Who would doubt one’s own occupation?

(321, 'Industry Trends to Exploit for 2022', 'https://www.insurancejournal.com/magazines/mag-features/2021/12/20/645843.htm', '<div><div>\n <p>It is imperative for agency owners to watch and learn about major trends when they start. Following are the eight key trends that insurance agencies should be tracking for 2022.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Insurtech Technology</strong></p>\n<p>Insurance and technology are like oil and water, they don’t mix well. During the 1990s and 2000s, the industry was replete with reports that automation was going to change the business model. Things did change but the carriers were very slow to adapt and did so reluctantly.</p>\n<p>For the last five or so years, reports indicated that the industry will be “disrupted” by insurtech. Young tech entrepreneurs were going to totally change how insurance is done and create a new business model that uses technology to cut costs, improve products, and improve the client’s experience. Well, the immovable object (the insurance industry) did meet the unstoppable force (insurtech) and the stodgy insurance industry is standing (relatively) still.</p>\n<p>The heady days of new and disruptive insurtech startups is behind us. Many of the promising insurtech startups were based on “vaporware” meaning the main improvement offered was marketing or perception rather than a substantial business model improvement using technology.</p>\n<p>Now that the dust has settled, the insurance industry and society, in general, are adopting technology as a part of the regular course of business. Pretty much everything is (or could be) cloud-based, and software is primarily mature and effective. The technology promises of the 1990s have arrived.</p>\n<p>Carriers, which were very slow to adapt to automation in the past, are expected to quickly incorporate new technology to improve their business model. Machine learning and AI will sort through and analyze all the “big data,” which will improve underwriting and cut costs. Blockchain (or distributed ledger technology) will seep into how business is done and offer greater transparency and security. Integration between the insurance industry and the wider ecosystem through application programming interface (API) will improve data, cut costs and result in better results for all parties. These are all evolutionary changes.</p>\n<p>If there is to be any “disruption” to the insurance industry from technology during 2022 and the next few years, it will be from technology changes to the world outside of insurance. For example, self-driving cars will change how auto liability insurance is handled. Technology such as sensors or artificial intelligence used in industrial equipment and consumer products will also change or shift the risk of losses. Healthcare insurance is also seeing many changes due to little things, such as fitness trackers, as well as big things, such as new surgical technology and telehealth.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Market Conditions</strong></p>\n<p>The current path shows hard market conditions to continue for early 2022 but conditions might change toward the second half of the year. The insurance market cycles between soft, or lower rates, and hard, or higher rates based on a variety of factors.</p>\n<p>2021 saw an increase in losses for many lines, which drove rates up. In general, the frequency of losses was not up, but the severity (dollar amount) of the claims was the key driver. Natural disasters during 2021 played a role in the increases of losses. Societal factors (social inflation), such as more litigation and larger settlement values and judgment claims played another key role. The excess casualty insurers had significant losses during 2021. The market reacted to these losses by cutting capacity and raising rates.</p>\n<p>Changes and new entrants to the market during 2021 are taking a foothold and this could mean the hard market trend will flip to a flat, or even a soft, market for many lines within one year. However, many industry experts see certain segments, such as cyber to continue seeing rate increases, driven by the increases in ransomware losses.</p>\n<p>Carriers are being creative with underwriting and additional capacity is entering the market. Most likely the concern and impact from COVID-19 will stabilize during 2022 and the economy might chug along within an acceptable plus and minus bandwidth. Most of the trends right now appear to be favorable to bringing a higher level of certainty to the market. However, a few wildcards, such as inflation and political change, can rapidly change the situation.</p>\n<p>The market rates seem to be splitting between the types of risk as carriers tighten up on underwriting. The better-quality risks will see low to moderate rate increases,', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

VCs seeded hundreds of companies to identify opportunities across life and health, and property and casualty. Most of this momentum came to a screeching halt in early 2022.</p><p>The newer cohort of innovators, or <a href="https://www.dig-in.com/list/insurtech-industry-outlook-2022-trends-and-predictions">insurtech 2.0</a>, recognizes the innovators who came before but takes a more nuanced and collaborative approach to disruption, recognizing that the legacy insurance industry is far too resilient to be demolished into rubble and completely rebuilt. More recently, the economy\xa0has made access to <a href="https://www.dig-in.com/list/insurtech-m-a-activity-with-vc-leaders-at-massmutual-nationwide-munich-re">capital more scarce</a>, forcing new entrants to think more critically about finding the real opportunities and strive for compelling unit economics. It\'s important to remember that Amazon, PayPal, Airbnb, Slack, Square, Facebook and many other world-changing companies cut their teeth in the last recession.\xa0</p><p>We are still in the early innings of insurtech 2.0, and some companies are already showing product market fit and poise on a path to maturity. 2023 is likely to bring customer-centric development and solidify insurtech 2.0s as a force to be reckoned with.\xa0 Here are five trends to watch in the new year:\xa0</p><ol><li>Disciplined growth: Insurtechs, while they need to capture market share and demonstrate product market fit, are eager to show better unit economics and combined ratios. The 2023 focus will be on acquiring the right customers, not every customer. Adverse selection is an age-old insurance term which I\'m certain every VC and insurtech has learned over the last few years. Expect to see smarter customer acquisition strategies next year and beyond.<br /></li><li>IOT impact:<i> </i>While insurtech 1.0 used <a href="https://www.dig-in.com/list/smart-home-tech-insurance-alliances-create-untapped-data">IOT predominantly </a>as marketing tools, expect to see the 2.0s show real impact on underwriting, claims, and loss control, meaningfully utilizing IOT in various insurance lines, particularly specialty commercial; think <a href="https://www.dig-in.com/news/interest-rises-in-edr-mfa-to-enhance-online-security">cybersecurity </a>products as a policy condition for cyber cover, wearables for workers compensation, and telematics for commercial auto.\xa0<br /></li><li><p>Hybrid distribution: The resiliency of the agent channel is now abundantly clear to all who were predicting their inevitable disintermediation just a couple of years ago. As insurtechs have recently been more willing to work with agents vs. around them, tech-forward agencies have responded in kind. Strong agency relationships will bring sustainable (and predictable) unit economics to insurtechs, and both parties will collaborate on novel ways to distribute products in 2023.</p><p>4. Data quality &gt; AI modeling: While AI models are a great tool for internal insights, regulators are still lukewarm at best on black box models as a means to price and segment risk. Equally as important, unexplainable pricing decisions lead to confusion and friction with agents and customers. If you can\'t explain your value proposition beyond price, you are in a race to adverse selection.

When we look back over many of the predictions from years past, it\'s easy to see why. Just a quick peek at the top trends insurance experts had for 2022 shows that many of them are the same topics we\'ve been talking about for years, such as digital transformation, partnership ecosystems, and using data and tech to understand customers better.\xa0</p><p>The insurance industry has indeed been slower to adapt. However, insurance is now at a significant inflection point. This change has been accelerated by the events of the last two years. Agencies have no choice but to accelerate their digital transformation initiatives, not just as a \'nice to have,\' but as a means of survival.\xa0</p><p><b>New crop of MGAs is leading the charge</b><br />What\'s driving the sense of urgency around digital? The next generation of tech-savvy, <a href="https://www.dig-in.com/opinion/mgas-strong-relationships-are-no-longer-enough">digital-first MGAs </a>has already stormed the gates, bringing VC-backed innovation with them. Some experts have referred to this new crop of MGAs as <a href="https://www.dig-in.com/list/insurtech-industry-outlook-2022-trends-and-predictions">"insurtech 2.0."</a> MGAs are gaining traction across the insurance distribution ecosystem, serving as intermediaries in the same way as retail agencies and brokers. However, unlike retail and wholesale brokers, MGAs often have binding authority from insurance partners. This means that MGAs can quote and bind policies that fit within the framework of their insurer partnerships. On top of that, MGAs often have expertise in niche or specialty lines of insurance, empowering them to create new risk products backed by their carrier partners.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/insurance-mgas-opportunities-and-considerations-for-investors"><u>McKinsey notes</u></a>, "Among the top 100 U.S. property and casualty insurers, 43%—including seven of the top ten—have at least one MGA relationship through which to source new premiums."</p><p>As retail agencies struggle to remain relevant and competitive with the insurtech 2.0 renegades, what can we expect in 2023?</p><p>Here are three predictions:</p><ol><li><b>The transition from retail agency to MGA.</b> This has been in the cards for years, but in 2023, it is inevitable. We should expect to see two common outcomes for retail agents: either they\'ll do what it takes to become an MGA, including gaining underwriting authority, or they\'ll hope to get purchased by one. The other alternative isn\'t so positive: losing business to MGAs. Startup MGAs are the ones driving the future trends in insurance, much more so than legacy agencies. They\'re growing rapidly, often by making strategic acquisitions based on product and line of business needs. Every retail agency will become an MGA in some form by the year 2025. Additionally, every current MGA will become an insurtech.\xa0</li><li><b>Agents marketing on tech platforms.</b> Agents, brokers, and MGAs will spend more on <a href="https://www.dig-in.com/opinion/how-to-develop-a-brand-strategy-for-insurtech-success">marketing </a>to prospects across other tech platforms, such as job recruiting sites and auto-buying apps. By marketing at the source, agents can quickly bring new customers into the pipeline. To do this, MGAs must have the right message and mix of risk products that make sense for these platforms, such as workers\' compensation insurance. The most tech-savvy MGAs are already doing this and offering prospects a seamless conversion that makes it easy for them to jump from the platform or app onto the M', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

But that\'s not how M&amp;A happens. It\'s when a CEO sees a strategic gap in the future, or a VP sees a gap in what he/she can get done in the next 12-18 months -- and fills that gap to with a deal, right or wrong.</li>\n <li><strong>VC multiples drive deal prices</strong>. Many deals are sort of valued off financial metrics and comps, but the actual price is often based on what would "clear" the VCs -- maybe 2x for the late-stage VCs (see Instagram, Yammer, etc. acquired at 2x last round price), or 3-4x mid-stage VCs. Corporate M&amp;A departments and others are OK with this because it\'s a process and this is what it takes to "clear" seemingly good deals.</li>\n \n <li><strong>M&amp;A is Capricious</strong>. Because M&amp;A is driven by individual executives at companies, not companies per se ... it\'s capricious. Especially at the non-CEO level. Priorities change. You may be just as good a strategic fit in 12 months, but if priorities change, that offer may never come back.

Then came 2021, when insurers focused on pandemic recovery and meeting customer expectations for digitization and personalization. 2022 will take the industry even further with an emphasis on hyper-personalization and data-driven ecosystems.</p><p>While adapting to the latest insurance technologies was a challenging experience for many carriers, those who did are selling more benefits faster and smarter than ever before.</p><p>From underwriting and claims to the customer journey and distribution methods, here are the top insurance technology trends our team believes will be beneficial to carriers in 2022.\xa0</p><h2> 22 Trends for 2022</h2><h2>1. Automated Underwriting</h2><p>It was once common for insureds to undergo in-person evaluations in traditional underwriting. However, this proved a challenge during the pandemic, and many insurers had to embrace new underwriting methods.</p><p>The goal of automated underwriting is to streamline information-gathering and reduce as many human touchpoints as possible. Automated underwriting uses tools and techniques like robotic process automation and artificial intelligence to import and correct data, assess risk and determine how much coverage a client should get and how much they should pay in premiums.\xa0</p><p>It is important that automated underwriting programs incorporate an insurer’s business rules, halting the process when human intervention is required. To this end, automated underwriting technology should enable granular configuration of roles and permissions.\xa0</p><p>The benefits of saving time and money have led to many insurers implementing automated underwriting into their value chain.\xa0</p><p>A report by LIMRA says\xa0more than a\xa0<a href="https://www.limra.com/en/newsroom/industry-trends/2020/limra-how-covid-19-is-affecting-life-insurance-in-the-u.s.-and-canada/">quarter of U.S. life insurers</a>\xa0have expanded their automated underwriting practices.</p><p></p><h2>2. Automated Claims</h2><p>The increased use of AI and digitized claims have allowed carriers to streamline disjointed claims management practices, resulting in faster processing and reduced claim wait times. More than\xa0<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/insurance-2030-the-impact-of-ai-on-the-future-of-insurance">half of claims activities have already been replaced\xa0</a>with automation.\xa0</p><p>In fact, fully digital claims have reduced the average payment time by up to 5.5 days and assisted in achieving the<a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2021-us-property-claims-satisfaction-study">\xa0highest satisfaction scores ever measured</a>\xa0by The J.D. Power U.S. Property Claims Satisfaction Study.\xa0</p><p>Jeff Wargin, Chief Product Officer of Duck Creek, explains more about the\xa0<a href="https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/news/breaking-news/tech-trends-that-will-transform-the-insurance-industry-in-2021-251194.aspx">value of machine learning in claims processing</a>;\xa0</p><blockquote>Machine learning cannot only improve claims processing – it can automate it. For example, when files are digital and accessible via the cloud, they can be analyzed using pre-programmed algorithms, improving processing speed and accuracy. This automated review can impact more than just claims – it can also be used for policy administration and risk assessment.</blockquote><p>Additionally, automating claims can help insurers sell more products to customers.\xa0</p><p>For example, say you are creating micro-insurance for farmers. Based on the analysis, you could use data analytics to determine if severe weather, low rainfall, or other factors could damage crops and pay claims. This can reduce settlement costs, enabling insurers to offer more competitive policies.\xa0</p><h2>3.

The add-ons are courtesy of the surge in demand for at-home amenities that came about as many of us were limited to our home spaces during pandemic shutdowns.</p>\n<p>With most property owners not disclosing these upgrades to the insurer many carriers found themselves with increased exposures at renewals; exposures they hadn’t factored into their premium rates.</p>\n<p>One insurer was able to bridge this coverage gap by tapping into images and insights captured over the span of three years by Nearmap aerial imaging.</p>\n<div><p></p><p>Kevin Tulp, Senior Solutions Engineer at Nearmap</p></div>\n<p>“The original name for the project was COVID pools,” said Kevin Tulp, senior solutions engineer at Nearmap.</p>\n<p>By using application programming interfacing (APIs), Tulp’s team, with the help of Artificial Intelligence-created models, pulled high-resolution images of nearly 1 million properties on the carrier’s book from 2019 to 2021 and found that 80,000 pools, or about 8% of its book of business, had been built.</p>\n<p>“Can you even imagine the premium leak on 80,000 pools?” Tulp shared.</p>\n<p>Not only did identifying these pools give the carriers the opportunity to help the property owners make sure their pools are being maintained properly, but it also recovered a substantial portion of that lost premium.</p>\n<p>Aircraft equipped with the company’s advanced camera systems continuously capture cities across the US as well as ad-hoc post-catastrophe event imagery; all of which consistently replenishes the imagery database.</p>\n<p>Being able to see over time what’s been happening on the ground is one part of the equation. Using deep-learning AI models, Nearmap extracts and digitizes property features such as roof materials and vegetation that provide insurers with an in-depth look at a building’s footprints. That visibility can strengthen risk reduction, (think vegetation management in wildfire-prone areas) and assist risk engineers and contractors in bolstering structural integrity.</p>\n<p>“Since we’re capturing [images] so often, on the underwriting piece they can reference prior images to understand the property beyond [what’s seen from] a human looking at it,” Tulp said. “And then we’re also driving our own machine learning, so we’re quantifying what we’re seeing.</p>\n<p>“We’re able to provide a cost-effective way to understand a carrier’s entire book of business,” he added.</p>\n<h3>High-res Imagery Combined with AI Changes the Underwriting Game</h3>\n<p>Getting a clear picture of damages after severe weather events and catastrophes is invaluable for first responders and government contractors, for sure.</p>\n<p>But when it comes to commercial and personal lines insurance, underwriters say that having the ability to fully integrate high-level location intelligence into their platforms changes the game for their operations.</p>\n<p>Even for carriers with GIS experts and catastrophe modelers on staff, aerial intelligence helps their data analytics teams get out of the Excel spreadsheets and sharpen their focus on the real risks they’re underwriting.</p>\n<p>“We actually really rely on it to look back at the time series of information,” said Bryan Adams, SVP, head of catastrophe analytics, Arch Insurance.

The industry has previously focused mainly on mass-market products to access the ‘easily insurable’ and deliver simple solutions that gained traction with this demographic. For anyone else, it has involved lengthy questionnaires, long-waiting times and this often means much higher premiums or no cover at all. This has resulted in an ever-increasing proportion of the population not having life protection and this gap is continuing to increase.</p>\n<p>The pandemic has certainly made us more aware of our personal health and mortality and it has shifted our focus with financial security, health and savings becoming much more important. Another major issue the industry is facing is the rapidly increasing number of over 65s with numbers predicted to double in the next 30 years, from nearly 800mn to 1.7bn. Admittedly a large part of this growth will be from developing countries such as India and China, but the traditional developed economies will continue to see an ever-increasing percentage of people over the age of retirement.</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle factors affecting life insurance</h2>\n<p>Along with an ageing population, we are also seeing a huge increase in the percentage of the world population with chronic illnesses who would have previously struggled to obtain a life insurance policy. Bluezone is focused on supporting these individuals and we are about to launch our first policy for people diagnosed with Type-2 diabetes.</p>\n<p>There are currently more than 3.8mn people diagnosed with diabetes in the UK alone, 90% of those with Type-2 and almost 1mn more people living with the chronic illness, who don\'t know they have it. In the last five years, there has been an alarming acceleration in the number of people diagnosed with the illness with the amount diagnosed increasing by 18%. This huge increase is not just happening in the UK, this trend is being seen across Europe, the US, India and many other countries and isn’t just diabetes, there are many other chronic illnesses impacting individual health and shifting more of the world population into the previously ‘uninsurable’ group.</p>\n<p>As the world evolves so too will the life insurance industry. The insurance and insurtech world is focused more than ever on what was historically a fairly stale and stagnant vertical in the industry. We have seen multiple players enter the market over the last few years such as Dead Happy with their tongue-in-cheek take on policies and simplified questionnaire, YuLife with their grouplife insurance and healthy life rewards solution and Vitality Life who are offering term and \'whole of life\' insurance with value added services such as an Apple Watch. Other players include Ladder life and Ethos life who along with many traditional insurers are looking to change the perception and offerings available.</p>\n<h2>New buyers bring new preferences</h2>\n<p>Another leading player in the life insurance space is LifeSearch and I was delighted to be joined by Debbie Kennedy, the CEO, at my recent panel discussion. Debbie and her team have developed an extensive portfolio of life insurance and income protection products. They offer a uniquely customer-centric approach and help individuals across the UK to find the cover they need based on their situation. This unique service has gained them 1.6mn customers and they have quickly become the biggest player in the UK.</p>\n<p>Traditional underwriting processes in the industry are still outdated, manual and cumbersome making it difficult for individuals, especially those with chronic illnesses, to easily access affordable life insurance.</p>\n<p>New buyers of life insurance have new preferences. They expect to buy the policy conveniently in a timely manner, they want to pay for their own health profile and not be grouped into pooled risks and expect to receive value whilst being a customer through digital services. Our new insurance product will address these preferences by offering personalised cover with no medical underwriting that can be bought online for individuals with Type-2 diabetes and will also offer rewards for individuals committed to improving their condition by making behavioural changes to their life.</p>\n<p><em>About the author: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-karan', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

New Models, Personalized Products</h4>\n<p>The digital economy will make usage-based, on-demand and \'all-in-one\' insurance lifestyle products more relevant. Customers will prefer personalized insurance covers instead of the one-size-fits-all products currently available.</p>\n<p>Today, more than 80 percent of the premiums collected by insurers is lost to distribution costs. Digital models will make <a href="https://www.wns.com/industries/insurance/insurance-intermediaries">intermediaries in the insurance</a> value chain\xa0-\xa0marked by their excessive dependence on human effort\xa0-\xa0obsolete.</p>\n<p>Flexible coverage options, micro insurance and peer-to-peer insurance will become viable options in the long run. Reinsurers will provide risk capital directly to digital brands, and regulatory frameworks will accommodate shorter value chains.</p>\n<p>Lifestyle apps will re-imagine the insurer-insured relationships. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) will enable the creation of insights-driven offerings as they integrate data from multiple sources. Deeper understanding of customer behaviors will lead to more accurate risk assessments, personalized premiums and value on a sustainable basis for better customer experience and brand loyalty, plus reduced false claims.</p>\n<h4>2. AI &amp; Automation for Faster Claims</h4>\n<p><a href="https://www.wns.com/capabilities/technology/wns-trac/rpa-intelligent-automation-trac">Robotic Process Automation</a> (RPA) and AI will occupy center stage in insurance, driven by newer data channels, better data processing capabilities and advancements in AI algorithms. For example, InsurTech company Lemonade\'s business model deploys AI and behavioral economics as its core elements. While AI eliminates brokers and paperwork, its behavioral economics capabilities minimize fraud\xa0-\xa0leading to reduced time, effort and costs.</p>\n<p>Another InsurTech firm Tyche has deployed an AI-infused claim likelihood model in underwriting to accurately determine the risks and achieve higher profitability.</p>\n<p>Bots will become mainstream in both the front and back-office to automate policy servicing and claims management for faster and more personalized customer service. For example, a leading U.S. auto insurer\'s virtual assistant answers customer queries on policies and payments. Lemonade\'s claims bot Jim assesses and pays out property claims in just three seconds.

Advanced Analytics &amp; Proactiveness</h4>\n<p>Premiums will become highly personalized, enabled by new sources of tech-enabled data such as Internet of Things, mobile-enabled InsurTech apps and wearables. With the connected devices market poised to grow strongly in the next five years, <a href="https://www.wns.com/industries/insurance/property-and-casualty">Property and Casualty (P&amp;C) insurers</a> will be able to extract real-time and accurate data on the loss exposure of individual consumers.

Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.finrafoundation.org/sites/finrafoundation/files/Financial-Education-Matters-Testing-Effectiveness-Financial-Education_1.pdf">the research</a> confirms that “students are more likely to budget, save and manage their credit after they take a financial literacy class."</p><p>Hoping to discover what high-quality financial literacy might look like, Gobir visited San Marcos High School and Mission Hills High School in Southern California, both about 30 miles from San Diego. She found that students at both schools were highly engaged in their financial coursework, and teachers were shocked by how popular the classes had become in a short period of time. “I went from thinking I was going to teach one section of [the class] to it being what I teach full time now,” says Jeff Montooth, a social science teacher at Mission Hills High School.</p><p>It’s a topic that can require some sensitivity, Montooth acknowledges, given students’ different economic backgrounds, so he often centers class discussions around his own financial journey—including the mistakes he’s made. That’s obviously not a requirement for teaching financial literacy, but Montooth says it helps put kids at ease. “By being open with them from the very beginning, I think it sets the tone of letting them know that it’s OK that somebody doesn’t have all the right answers,” Montooth tells Gobir.</p><p>While a stand-alone financial literacy course may not be in the cards for many schools, we curated a set of ideas—drawn from Gobir’s reporting and from our archives—that teachers are using to slip engaging lessons about money, savings, and financial planning into the curriculum.</p><p>\n</p><h3>Play credit score Jenga</h3>\n<p></p><p>To teach her high school students about credit scores, Kailen Stover, a family and consumer sciences teacher in Colorado, likes a <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/article/getting-started-teaching-personal-finance">riff on the game of Jenga</a>.

No change”). As the game progresses, students keep track of how each event impacts their overall credit score—for better or for worse. If someone knocks over their tower, it’s financial catastrophe: The person’s credit score plummets.</p><p>\n</p><h3>Draft budgets for the future</h3>\n<p></p><p>At both high schools that Gobir visited, students were asked to imagine their future lives, then attempt to sketch out a corresponding budget.

Generally speaking, the study found that performance on the test correlated with key indicators of financial capability. On the most recent test, just over a third of respondents got four or more questions out of five correct, suggesting widespread financial illiteracy.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome changes in consumer habits and financial products have made it harder for Americans to manage their finances. In the past, most people used cash for daily purchases. Today, they use credit cards more frequently. In 2019, credit use accounted for 27% of payments, up from 24% in 2017. The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/how-we-shop-now-5184434">way we shop</a> has also changed.

It means understanding how to earn, spend, save, manage and invest money.

Most articles on personal finance or financial literacy will go right into how to set a budget, the benefits of saving, and the impact of interest rates. At that point, the majority of individuals lose interest (pun intended) and move on to something else.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to keep your attention, let’s spend some time looking at the “<strong>why</strong>” of financial literacy, not just the “<strong>how</strong>.”</p>\n<h2>Financial literacy is about improving your life</h2>\n<p>While this subject may not be as exciting to you as it is to me, hopefully we can at least agree that money can have a significant impact on our everyday lives. My personal belief is that money doesn’t necessarily buy happiness; it isn’t just about buying that brand new car or newest gadget. However, money can allow a person to have more flexibility, reduce stress and improve relationships.</p>\n<p>Living beyond our means can contribute to bankruptcy, divorce and massive stress.

And they\'re right—a financial literacy course can teach all of that.</p>\n<p>But there\'s so much more. At its core, financial literacy is about extending equal opportunities to all, regardless of socioeconomic background. It\'s about breaking down the barriers between the haves and the have-nots. It\'s a powerful tool for social justice that can arm people of all economic backgrounds with the knowledge, skill, and training they need to thrive in an increasingly complicated and competitive world.</p>\n<p>Think, for example, about the student who grows up believing that college is off the table because it\'s too expensive. Or the young worker who\'s denied a job because of a poor credit report. Or the woman who\'s stuck in an abusive relationship because her husband controls the family money.\xa0</p>\n<p>These are just a few examples of the insidious ways in which a lack of financial literacy can undermine a person\'s full potential.

The disparity is striking and unacceptable. \xa0</p>\n<p>According to a study by finaid.org, at least 1.7 million students fail to file the FAFSA financial aid form each year because they incorrectly believe themselves to be ineligible.

(337, 'What Is Financial Literacy?', 'https://www.edutopia.org/blog/what-is-financial-literacy-lennette-coleman', '<div><div><p>What is financial literacy? There are many definitions floating about, and most are based upon a knowledge and understanding of personal finance and financial institutions.</p><div><h3>Beyond Personal Finance</h3><p>The public is faced with nearly two decades of struggling global economies, unemployment, and the collapse of numerous financial institutions. Very few families have not experienced the fear of uncertain personal finances and felt concern about being financially stable and secure in their future. Yet, within the same time frame, changes in legislation for investment, saving, retirement, and capital lending have provided the opportunity for individuals to acquire wealth through entrepreneurship and investing.</p></div><div><p>Therefore, our definition of <strong>financial literacy</strong> encompasses more than just personal finance. To be financially literate, an individual does need to be fluent in personal finance, but also in global economics, entrepreneurship, and investing -- all on a platform of real-time technology.</p><p>Personal finance has moved beyond merely balancing your checkbook and saving for a rainy day. Most banking and financial transactions happen online and in real time, and they can involve and intersect with several institutions and individuals in a matter of seconds. The need to access and utilize money can be immediate. It also requires an understanding of how to navigate personal finance technologically at an early age, which is a necessity today.</p><p>Global economics impact everyone. Long before the era of industrialization, trade and commerce between countries and continents were interconnected and interdependent. Currently, struggling economies have brought more individuals who seek entrepreneurial endeavors. Entrepreneurship is more than having an idea for a product to manufacture. Ideas, services, and even commentary and critique now have a market -- and a market value. Entrepreneurship is about seizing an opportunity to advance ourselves and our ideas, and to benefit financially from the interests and needs of others.</p><p>Investing is the jewel in the crown. It is simply not enough for an individual to work hard and earn money. You need to make the money that you earn work hard for you! Investing is the greatest source of accumulating and maintaining wealth. There are a myriad of ways to invest, allowing even the hard-working individual to grow his or her finances and secure a comfortable future.</p><h3>Teaching Financial Literacy: An Open Invitation</h3><p>In terms of public education, financial literacy is unexplored territory. School districts acknowledge that it is necessary for students to be financially literate in order to be college and career ready. However, it is difficult for schools and districts to consider how they will achieve that goal. What content should be included? What specific skills should students be equipped with? How can the curriculum and instruction engage students in real and meaningful ways? How can students understand the ways in which financial literacy applies to their immediate worlds? The stakeholders in this conversation are public partners, financial institutions, and government entities. Missing from the conversation are teachers.</p><p>Every school administrator knows that teacher buy-in is critical. Even the best data-driven, research-based curricula, without teacher ownership, becomes just a set of expensive worksheets. Teachers need to know and understand what it takes to become financially literate and why it is so necessary. They must be at the forefront of defining what financial literacy is and what it is not.</p><p>I am inviting teachers of economics, business, social sciences, math -- and in fact, all subjects at all levels -- to join in this conversation. In the comments section below, share your ideas on this unexplained territory. Share your experiences, and please provide the defining components to a new body of knowledge that will lead our students into the next millennium.</p></div></div>', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

It helps people gain skills they can use to improve their lives, which in turn boosts the economy. In third-world countries, where fewer people receive an education, poverty is rife, and most people never achieve their potential. </p>\n<p>Math and literacy skills are the foundation stones of a good education but don’t underestimate the importance of financial literacy. Being able to make financially responsible decisions has a far-reaching effect on our lives and the lives of those around us. Indeed, one could argue that the global financial crash of 2009 was, in part, caused by individuals in positions of power making financially irresponsible decisions.</p>\n<h2><b>The Perils of Uncontrollable Spending</b></h2>\n<p>On a personal level, a lack of financial literacy will probably lead you into debt. This is not great for you, but if you are in a position of responsibility, perhaps in charge of your family’s finances, or even in a job where you are required to manage money, it could be disastrous. </p>\n<p>Let’s use Dennis Kozlowski, CEO of Tyco, as an example. Kozlowski’s financial incompetence knew no bounds. Whilst he was good at his job, he soon realized it was helpful if the company picked up the tab for his personal spending. He used company money to fund a $19 million NYC apartment and spent a further $11 million on furnishings. He also granted himself unauthorized bonuses and charged a $2 million birthday party to the company. But, the good life eventually unraveled. In the end, tax evasion was his undoing and he ended up in prison. </p>\n<p>Most people don’t commit major financial fraud or end up doing time in jail because of financial incompetence but making poor money decisions could easily lead to credit card debt, escalating pay day loans, and the bank foreclosing on your home. None of these scenarios is especially attractive, which is why a good financial education is a smart investment. </p>\n<h2><b>What is Financial Literacy?</b></h2>\n<p>At its most basic level, financial literacy means being able to understand how to budget, plan for your retirement, and avoid debt, whether you live in London or Nairobi. On a more sophisticated level, someone with a high degree of financial literacy might have success trading in forex or stocks.</p>\n<p>Whilst a lack of financial education is a real problem in the developing world, it can also be problematic in developed countries too<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/may/27/financial-illiteracy-young-people-oecd-study">. An OECD study published in 2017</a>, focusing on 15-year-olds in 15 different countries, found that only 22% of teens had basic financial literacy. Chinese teens have far less money to spend than European or American kids, but they scored much higher on financial literacy. Interestingly, the US ranks below Canada, Belgium, and even Australia, where kids are far more likely to understand the fundamentals of short-selling Australia or compound interest.</p>\n<p>Amazingly, financial literacy is rarely taught in school. A college student can spend three years studying the intricacies of molecular biology, earning a first-class honors degree, and still remain dangerously clueless about the merits of balancing a household budget. But, without this knowledge, you will struggle to build wealth and attain a high degree of financial security in the future. </p>\n<p>The OCED study recommended that children are taught financial literacy in school. As financial products become increasingly complex and kids have ever-greater choices over which products they buy, it is imperative that they learn the basics in school. Arguably, parents should be teaching their children about financial topics, but may parents are themselves financially illiterate.</p>\n<h2><b>Educating Kids about Money and Finance</b></h2>\n<p>Most kids learn the art of saving when they receive pocket money.

De Kempenaer pointed to signs that the rally in U.S. stocks has broadened dramatically over the past month as cyclical areas of the market, like industrials, materials, consumer discretionary, financials and small-cap stocks have joined megacap technology names in powering the rally. </p> <p>As a result, the number of S&amp;P 500 \n <a href="/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote">SPX,\n +0.85%</a>\n stocks trading above their 50-day moving average, a closely watched momentum gauge frequently used by technical analysts, has risen to 83.2% as of Wednesday’s close. That’s up from a low of 16.4% on March 10, according to StockCharts data.</p> <p>“There was a long period of people saying that this was a very fragile market. But that has stopped,” Kempenaer said during a phone interview with MarketWatch. </p> <p>“The fact that this is happening while the Fed is still raising rates makes it even more impressive,” he added.</p> <p>Here are a few other notable factoids that illustrate just how far the market has come from the doldrums of last fall. </p><ul> <li> \n The S&amp;P 500 has risen 26% off its closing low on October 4 last year of 3,577.03, according to FactSet data. \n </li> <li> \n The index closed at 4,357.86 on March 16, 2022, the day the Fed announced its first interest rate hike of the cycle. Stocks are now trading more than 3% above that level. \n </li> <li> \n On Jan. 4, 2022 year the S&amp;P 500 hit an all-time intraday high of 4,818.62. The index is now within 7.2% of this level. \n </li> </ul> <p>To be sure, the technical setup isn’t the only factor working in the market’s favor.

Of course, this was not expected. Last year, equities in the United States could only be described as volatile and largely underperforming. The macroeconomic environment, already beleaguered with sustained supply chain bottlenecks from the pandemic, intensified in part by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, causing commodities prices to elevate globally. The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised the federal funds rate 11 times since the central bank began its fight against inflation. However, there is still much to consider with stocks in 2024.</p>\n<p>Despite all the frantic headlines, the Federal Reserve has come a long way. The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">latest consumer price index reading</a> has inflation only rising 3.2% throughout the past 12 months, trailing behind where it peaked in July 2022 at 9.1%. The Fed’s ability to tame inflation without putting a wrench into U.S. economic growth spurred confidence in businesses, consumers, and investors alike. The <a href="https://app.koyfin.com/charts/gm/ec-v7clkt#"><strong>Standards and Practices (S&amp;P) 500</strong> and the Nasdaq have risen 16.1% and 31.4%</a>, respectively, in value year-to-date. Below are three reasons why global stocks still have plenty of room to rally in 2024.\n</p>\n<h2>The U.S. Federal Reserve could Begin Cutting Rates</h2>\n<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates since June 2022 to combat inflation, which <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2022/consumer-prices-up-9-1-percent-over-the-year-ended-june-2022-largest-increase-in-40-years.htm">reached a peak of 9.1%</a> in June of last year. Despite equities performing well overall in 2023, there have definitely been bouts of volatility due to analysts wondering what the Fed will do next. Nonetheless, there is a lot of encouraging developments in the recently released economics data. While the consumer price index (<strong>CPI</strong>) came in at its lowest in last month’s read, there was also positive developments in the labor market where the Fed has been the most concerned. While <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-job-growth-picks-up-august-wages-gains-slow-2023-09-01/">U.S. job growth picked up</a> in August, wage growth moderated and the unemployment spiked to 3.8%. For those who were concerned about a wage pressure in the U.S. labor market, those pressures seem to have tempered.</p>\n<p>When the Fed convenes again this month, analysts expect them to hold rates steady, but that does mean there will not be another hike later this year.\xa0 There very well could be another hike, but given Federal Reserve officials, including Jerome Powell himself, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/despite-what-powell-says-the-fed-is-likely-done-72e4f142?mod=finance_lead_pos1">have signaled they want to proceed with caution</a>, investors probably have little to worry about here. The U.S. central bank is likely at the end of its rate hike cycle, which means the Fed could start cutting rates in early next year. Lower interest rates would have the effect of reducing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, stimulating spending and investment, and, of course, boosting stock valuations.</p>\n<h2>The U.S. Economy is Likely Headed for a ‘Soft-Landing’ Scenario</h2>\n<p>Some economists and market analysts were concerned the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes would push the U.S. economy into a recession in later in 2023.

In other words, traders research the historical price actions to calculate the future price actions of a currency pair. These kind of Forex traders use technical resources, such as charts, trends, and different types of indicators. However, fundamental trading, also called Forex News trading, can be just as successful, if not more. In fact numerous advanced Forex traders do nothing else but to trade the economic news.</p>\n<p>So how will you benefit with <a href="http://www.currencynewstrading.com/">Forex News trading</a>?</p>\n<p>Forex news trading is really an approach that a lot of Forex traders overlook. Let’s face it, there is so much buzz about trading the latest very best automated EA that Forex news trading just becomes mostly overlooked. The simple truth is, News trading can be an useful tool to obtain in your arsenal. Even if you are now running an impressive signal service or the best automated robot, understanding the news can make you more profitable or maybe assist you to avoid big losses. Knowing the fundamentals of a market is vital but using it with a trading system or using it with automated Forex indicator is how its real worth comes in.</p>\n<p>First of all, let me start with describing which are the economic news and how you can trade them. Its nothing more than the economic facts relating to a country’s economy. These economic information are worth paying attention to simply because they can have a significant effect on the movement of specific currency pairs. Therefore, it presents the possiblility to make money if you know the right way to interpret these market headlines and its implications. This is a highly effective technique in itself and it\'s the basis of Forex News Trading, but the more you monitor how the markets react to these market headlines, the more experience you\'re going to get and the much better you will be able to predict the direction of the market. It is often said, that once you know the direction of the market, you already possess a 50 Percent possibility that a trade can be profitable.</p>\n<p>It\'s important to remember that some market headlines possess a higher impact than others. As an example, the US FOMC Rate decision can have a dramatic impact on the USD currency pair’s movement, while the US Trade Balance data will seldom move the USD pairs.</p>\n<p>The high impact market headlines are undoubtedly well worth paying attention to, even if you are a purely technical trader. The high impact news can create crazy swings and changes in market volatility, and will frequently make technical trading or most automated EAs completely unbeneficial over these situations.</p>\n<p>The first thing to do is to trade the spike during these high impact news releases, or hold on a couple of minutes for the market to settle before getting into any trades. Often times, just minutes after the market spikes, you will have a possible opportunity to get intoa trade at a much better price. Let Us say the US Non- Farm Payroll release is incredibly positive, and you may decide to immediately go long on the USD /JPY or go short on the EUR/ USD. However, you can actually hold out a couple of minutes for the retracement, before getting into a trade on the route of the spike.</p>\n<p>Forex news trading is undoubtedly not easy, and isn\'t for everyone. The truth is, simplest way to start is by applying a variety of methods. If you have signals on your side, you can check the news and even take a look at the trend in order to evaluate the route of the currency pairs.

(367, 'Is the Commodities Market in a Bubble ?', 'https://www.managementstudyguide.com/is-the-commodities-market-in-a-bubble.htm', '<div><div>\n<br />\n<h3>Under investments</h3>\n<p>During the 19th and 20th century, the industrial revolution took place. Industrialization was considered to be synonymous with modernization and agriculture and related activities were frowned upon and considered to be primitive. Therefore, during this period, almost all of the economic resources available at the disposal of society were spent towards development of industry or towards building financial markets.</p>\n<p>This has created a strange situation. The number of farms and farmers has been steadily declining whereas the number of people in the world has been steadily increasing. This went on for several decades and as a result, the world today is facing a food shortage. This under investment in agriculture and related industry is an irrefutable truth. However, at the present moment, it is being used as a back story to justify the unsustainable boom in commodities. It is true that the commodities are scarce. However, this scarcity has been greatly exaggerated.</p>\n<p><b>The fall in commodity prices since 2015 has brought an end to almost two decades of incessant and unrequited price rise</b>.</p>\n<h3>Debt Ridden Economic Policies</h3>\n<p>The western world has faced major economic upheavals in the past decade. The markets almost crashed and left many people homeless. In such scenarios, the pressure on the governments steadily mounted and they were forced to take some decisions which cannot be considered to be economically wise.</p>\n<p>Almost all western countries in the world have lowered their interest rates. Many countries have maintained zero interest rates whereas other have crossed the line of absurdity and ventured into negative interest rates! Also, during the same time the United States has had three bouts of heavy duty currency expansion called the quantitative easing 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The use of QE helped them to solve their problems temporarily. Therefore such policies are likely to be emulated in Europe as well.</p>\n<p>These economic policies cause the inflation to rise. Commodities are considered to be a hedge against inflation. Hence an expansionary monetary policy brings about a bull run in the commodities market. The problem is that this Bull Run has gotten out of hand in the past few years. Also, it is very unlikely that this Bull Run will continue in the future which is why the highly priced commodities are almost certainly in an economic bubble.</p>\n<h3>The US Dollar Decline</h3>\n<p>The United States has been at the forefront when it comes to debasing their currency. The dollar is said to have lost 94% of its value during the last century. The modern financial system prices all commodities in terms of the dollar. All important commodities are therefore priced in terms of the dollar. A decline in the price of the dollar appears to be a rise in the price of the underlying commodity.</p>\n<p>The value of the US dollar seems to have hit rock bottom. It may not drop too much in the future. Hence, extrapolating the previous growth in commodity rates to create a basis for the future is likely to bring in an economic bubble which cannot be sustained by the fundamentals.</p>\n<h3>Financialization</h3>\n<p>The commodities markets were consumer markets. In the past five decades or so, commodities markets have been financialized. This means that commodities are now being used as alternate investment classes. Therefore people who want to diversify their stock and bond portfolio do so by investing in commodities. The development of commodities as an alternate source of investment has brought in a tsunami of additional capital. This additional capital is temporary in nature and may flow to a different asset class soon.</p>\n<p>The development of financial markets and derivative instruments to manage commodities trading may have made life simpler for a few farmers and traders. However, it seems like it has created a bubble of epic proportions as it allows speculators to take massive positions even though they have no interest in the underlying.</p>\n<h3>The China India Story</h3>\n<p>The China India growth story has also been another major cause behind the boom in commodity markets. These two countries are rich in natural resources and are also the two largest populations in the world. As these countries have maintained sky high GDP growth rates, they have also used huge quantities of commodities. The unprecedented growth has been fuelled by oil, cement, food grains and energy ! Now the economies seem to have stabilized. In fact it is likely that these economies might soon be in decline. Also, China has grown significant internal capabilities and has in fact become a net exporter of some of these commodities.</p>\n<', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')
(368, 'Why to be Bullish on Commodities ?', 'https://www.managementstudyguide.com/why-to-be-bullish-on-commodities.htm', '<div><div>\n<br />\n<p>Commodities are like stocks and other securities. There values could theoretically go up and down over the long term. Some experts have been suggesting that the future holds a particularly good time to be invested in commodities. They believe that there are several demographic factors which make commodities a more preferable investment as compared to the others. This article lists down why this is the case.</p>\n<p><b>Some of the major reasons for an investor to be bullish on commodities are as follows:</b></p>\n<h3>Population Explosion</h3>\n<p>The world is on the brink of population explosion. Almost all countries in the world are experiencing simultaneous record increases in their population. Commodities are essential in nature. Therefore if the number of people present in the world increases, so does the demand for essential commodities. In fact there are several studies which predict a shortage of essential commodities and a resulting famine. From an investors perspective the demand is pretty high and there is almost zero chance of it dropping down in the future. Hence, investment in commodities is a good investment bet given that the current valuation is appropriate. The fundamentals are strong, only the valuation needs to be appropriate.</p>\n<h3>Urbanization</h3>\n<p>Developing countries like India and China are urbanizing at a pace which has not been heard of before. At the present moment, less than 15% of the world’s population resides in cities. However, this rate is expected to be higher than 50% by 2030!</p>\n<p>Newer smart cities are being built to accommodate the burgeoning population of these nations and the real estate sector is in a boom. This is a very positive scenario for commodities. This is because many metals like iron and steel are extensively used in the construction of houses and buildings. Also, commodities like cement play a vital role in these construction projects.</p>\n<p>Therefore as more houses and buildings are being built, the demand for these commodities is skyrocketing. This scenario is expected to sustain for several years if not decades! From an investor’s point of view, once again this represents a stable investment in a stream of growing cash flows which could sustain for several years. This is definitely going to exert an upward pressure on the price of commodities.</p>\n<h3>Industrialization</h3>\n<p>The world witnessed a huge wave of industrialization in the 19th Century. This is what created the western world or the developed world as we know today. A second such wave is already underway. This wave is transforming almost all countries. However, the frontrunners of the modern day industrial revolution are the BRIC countries i.e. Brazil, Russia, India and China.</p>\n<p>The Chinese economy has been growing over 9% per annum for several years. Indian economy is close on its heels with growth rates hovering around 7%. With a large number of citizens in working age population, these countries are bound to witness a repeat of the industrial revolution. This is good news for commodities as most factories are built using commodities and also a large number of the raw materials used in the production process are commodities too.</p>\n<h3>Inelasticity</h3>\n<p>The economic concept of elasticity is the degree to which the demand for a good fluctuates with its price. Hence if a small change in price causes a big change in demand, the product is said to be elastic. However, commodities usually have an inelastic demand. This is because they are usually necessary to maintain a good living condition. For instance the demand for heating and electricity is not optional in the modern world. Neither is the demand for not having a home or not eating food. People will continue to buy these good unless they are ridiculously overpriced. From an investor’s point of view having control over such commodities seems like a good value proposition which is likely to pay out rich dividends in the future.</p>\n<h3>Safe Haven</h3>\n<p>Commodities such as gold and silver also provide a safe haven in times of turmoil. These metals have been used as money for centuries and still provide a safe haven if crisis breaks out. For example, any crisis from Weimar Germany to modern day Zimbabwe has seen the system of fiat money collapsing and has the price of gold and silver rising. The quantitative easing that is being undertaken by western governments is likely to bring about a hyperinflation in the developed nations. If such a scenario were to present itself, the demand for gold and silver would simply skyrocket. This is why investors such as central banks are queuing', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Cryptocurrency trends are beginning to deviate from the maximalist patterns of bitcoin. By implication, this means that bitcoin may experience depreciation in its value for a short period of time in 2022. Hence, lower bitcoin prices may bring about a rise in the value of altcoins.</p>\n<p>Are you still unsure about which altcoins you want to invest in? Not to worry, studying altcoin strategies does not have to be confusing or complicated.</p>\n<p>In addition, since the launch of bitcoin in 2009, several global schools, universities, and institutions have been expressing great interest in the acceptance of bitcoin payments. Only a small number of them are however practically accepting it today. Thankfully, 2022 is predicted to see a growth in this trend with more schools and universities embracing bitcoin donations and bitcoin payments.

This is as a result of the mass installation of bitcoin ATMs taking place in different parts of the world.</p>\n<p>By incorporating cryptocurrencies into the real world, people will be able to understand better how palpable these digital assets can actually be.</p>\n<p>As cryptocurrencies are anticipated to increase even more in popularity in 2022, we will also witness the start of a new dawn for crypto brokers, with an increasing number of them gearing up their game and expanding their services. Crypto brokers will leverage innovative features to capture the interest of more traders.

The fact that bitcoin mining as well as its consumption of energy has had an insufferable impact on the price of the digital token will remain in the hearts of investors. Hence, it is anticipated that the generations to come will work to devise innovative solutions for reducing the carbon footprint on the mining of bitcoin.</p></li>\n<li>\n<h3>Boost in crypto\xa0education</h3>\n<p>Recently, there has been an increase in the demand for cryptocurrency education.

We have been involved with hundreds of deals and have seen how many deals go wrong often for reasons that were predictable, knowable, and avoidable to the buyer.</p>\n<p>Here is what I call the 7 Deadly Sins of Mergers and Acquisitions and the pitfalls you must avoid in doing a deal.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Not Doing the Math- will 1 plus 1 equal 3?</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s say you’re Company A, and you have your eye on acquiring Company B. Ideally, 1 plus 1 will equal 3 if you buy Company B. Too often, it turns out to be more like 1 plus 1 equals 1.5. \xa0Why? - You need to understand what the combined companies will look like. I recommend that you start with a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis of your company, a SWOT analysis of Company B and a combined analysis, the ‘layering effect.’</p>\n<p>Of course it’s easier to do SWOT on your own company (though I am surprised at how often companies don’t) than it is do to it on another company, especially a privately held one, but you can still get information on Company B. There are sources like Factiva, Capital IQ, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/companies/google/">Google</a> (and the rest of the Internet) and then there are the industry publications. Have your key management speak to other people in the industry to help size up your target. This can help you get a sense of what the two companies really look like together.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Getting Emotional</strong></p>\n<p>As CEO, you are undoubtedly passionate about your business. That’s to be expected and applauded. Getting emotional about completing a deal is different. You get excited about the possibilities of buying Company B, and before you know it your enthusiasm becomes infectious, to the point where your key management does not challenge you about downside risks of doing the deal. Getting emotional can keep you in a deal that shouldn’t go forward.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Losing Perspective</strong></p>\n<p>Losing perspective is about getting lost in the process. If you’ve invested a lot of resources – time, talent, money – exploring the deal, it’s easy to think that you have to go forward with the acquisition irrespective of the price you pay. Ask yourself why you want to buy Company B. In your layering effect analysis, does it contribute to your top line (sales) or bottom line (profitability)? \xa0Do you gain a new distribution channel? Does it eliminate a competitor? Make sure that it is a well-founded rationale and a sound business case that is moving you forward, and not the sheer force of momentum.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Ignoring Red Flags</strong></p>\n<p>Red flags are signals to pause or even stop. Failing to do so is often a byproduct of getting emotional or losing perspective. Don’t close your eyes to the red flags. Did Company B have unusual charges or losses that aren’t adequately explained? Does the predictive index (assessment) on the CEO show instability? Is there unusually high turnover on its management team? Trouble fulfilling orders? Are there cultural gaps that will make it difficult to combine people and departments from both companies? In my experience, the No. 1 reason mergers fail is because of cultural incompatibility.</p>\n<p>There are hundreds of potential red flags. \xa0Don’t ignore them. Don’t try to justify them away. Dig deeper, ask questions, and if you aren’t satisfied with the answers or can’t find resolution, walk away.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Thinking Inside the Box</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s say you see some red flags, or your layering-effect analysis does not make sense. It’s time to review your other options. What if you only bought part of company B? Or maybe it would make sense to partner with another party to buy Company B. \xa0What about a joint venture?

When viewed in perfect hindsight, it\n often seems that simple common sense, or lack thereof, was the reason\n for the success or failure of a deal. Unfortunately, there is no\n specific formula for structuring a perfect deal, but a good\n understanding of the potential hazards relating to the variables\n involved and planning for the unexpected can help your firm prepare a\n better deal structure and business plan.</p>\n <p>This article highlights some of the major reasons deals fail to meet\n the original strategic, financial, and professional objectives of the\n combining firms. A companion article in the April issue of the <i>JofA\n </i>will take a closer look and offer guidance for client and staff\n retention in mergers. The minutiae of certain details have purposely\n been eliminated as it is rarely the numbers (such as the size of the\n firms’ revenue) or a merger’s financial terms that cause the failure.\n The lessons apply to firms of all sizes, whether a small one-to\n two-partner firm or a national firm.</p>\n <p>\n WHY SOME DEALS FAIL\n <br />\n <b>1. Affiliating for the wrong reasons</b>\n <br />A merger or an acquisition has a major impact on the partners,\n staff and clients of both firms. The potential M&amp;A transaction\n should ideally result in a significant upside or solution to a major\n problem. Merging to merely reduce overhead in one or both firms (for\n instance, to fill empty office space, spread technology costs, or\n utilize excess staff) is a reason for many mergers, but is often a\n poor foundation for an affiliation. It would be much less traumatic to\n just shed the excess costs or to set up a space-sharing arrangement\n between the firms.</p>\n <p>Sometimes, the misconception that “bigger is better” can lead to a\n deal failure. In many cases, bigger will be better only if the\n combined firm understands and is prepared to take advantage of the\n benefits of scale, but realizes the efficiencies and efficacy of a\n larger firm is not automatic. On the other hand, some excellent\n reasons to merge, sell or acquire are planning for the succession for\n the owners of one firm, increasing a pool of talent, opening access to\n new marketplaces, and adding niche services or expanding the reach of\n existing specialties through cross-selling.</p>\n \n <p>\n Tips for a Successful Affiliation\n <br />These tips can improve the chances for success in an affiliation:</p>\n <p>\n \xa0In an acquisition, the financial terms for the successor\n should create positive cash flow, hopefully from the beginning. This\n does not mean the selling firm has to accept less proceeds. A longer\n payout period may be sufficient. In a merger, both firms should\n usually contribute billed and unbilled receivables instead of one firm\n expecting to cash in. This will relieve the burden of carrying\n overhead until collections from combined operations start rolling in.</p>\n <p>\n Prior to a merger, both firms should have a complete\n business plan to which they are committed that addresses the combined\n name, marketing, roles of each partner and key staff member, a\n complete transition plan including the message that will be given to\n clients and staff, and the method to be used to notify varying groups\n of clients.</p>\n <p>\n Make sure culture is addressed early in the process.\n Employees transition best when their original work environment is\n maintained to the extent possible to accommodate existing policies and\n other operational features.</p>\n <p>\n Get help. If there are 50 things a person needs to know\n about making a deal successful, the smartest among us may only think\n of 35.

It sounds too good to be true. And yet until recently there was relatively little inflationary consequence from all of this money printing. And even the recent spike in <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Inflation.html">inflation</a> could have been prevented if the central banks had raised rates a bit sooner.</p><p>But when something is too good to be true, there’s usually a catch. For the most part, central banks weren’t actually “printing money”.\xa0 Rather they were buying longer-term bonds paying 2% interest with newly issued interest bearing reserves, which at the time paid almost no interest at all. Central banks were essentially operating the world’s largest hedge funds. Borrowing short-term at low rates and lending long-term at a higher rate.\xa0</p></div>\n<p>But that carry trade remains profitable only so long as short-term rates stay lower than the rates on previously issued longer-term bonds. The vast <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Profits.html">profits</a> earned by central banks over the past 13 years would turn into losses if short-term interest rates rose sharply.

A recent report by Frank Van Lerven and Dominic Caddick of the New Economics Foundation, a British think-tank, calls for them to pay interest on only a sliver of reserves that affects their decision-making, rather than the whole lot. The ECB\xa0and the Bank of Japan already have such a “tiered” system. It was designed to protect commercial banks from the negative interest rates they have imposed in recent years.</p>\n<p>Using tiering to avoid paying banks interest while their funding costs went up would be a tax in disguise. Banks, considered together, have no choice but to hold the reserves QE\xa0has force-fed into the system. Compelling them to do it for nothing would be a form of financial repression which may impair banks’ ability to lend. It would “transfer the costs [of rising rates] to the banking sector,” Sir Paul Tucker, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, told parliament in 2021.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maybe I’m missing something, but I have trouble following their argument.\xa0 It’s hard to see how banks could be induced to maintain their large holdings of excess reserves if the reserves did not earn interest while other risk-free assets such as T-bills earned a positive rate of interest.\xa0 Back in 2007, short-term interest rates in the US were about 5% and thus banks held only a tiny amount of excess reserves.\xa0 Today, excess reserves are now roughly 1000-fold higher than before the Fed began paying IOR in 2008.\xa0</p>\n<p>There’s a reference to the tiered system in Japan and Europe, but that involved paying a <em>higher</em> interest rate on the infra-marginal reserve holdings (that is zero interest instead of the negative interest rate on the marginal holdings.)</p>\n<p>It’s also a bit misleading to suggest that banks, in aggregate, are somehow “forced” to hold reserves injected through QE programs.\xa0 One problem is that banks could make deposits less attractive and a portion of the reserves would leak out as currency.\xa0 But even if you assume a world without currency, where 100% of the monetary base is bank reserves, it is still misleading to suggest that banks are forced to hold excess reserves just because the central bank injects them into the system.</p>\n<p>Here it is useful to recall the distinction between the nominal supply of bank reserves and the real demand for bank reserves.\xa0 Central banks determine the nominal stock of reserves, while the commercial banking system determines the real stock of', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

(381, '4 Innovative Trends in the Crypto Market for 2022 - Crypto Coin Growth', 'https://cryptocoingrowth.com/4-innovative-trends-crypto-market-for-2022', '<div><div>\n<p>Cryptocurrencies had great trends and an amazingly successful market year in 2021. Nearly half of the consumers who own Bitcoin (BTC) in the U.S. bought their first cryptos last year. In addition, the sectors of non-fungible token (NFT) and decentralized finance experienced booming success. In fact, multiple leading cryptocurrencies had gains of greater than 5,000 percent. You may be wondering what the major trends in crypto are for 2022.</p>\n<h2>Major Trends in the Cryptocurrency Market for 2022</h2>\n<p>Significant trends in 2022 for the cryptocurrency market include the following:</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<h3>1. Extended Growth in Gaming and the Metaverse</h3>\n<p>Blockchain gaming gained a stronghold with high consumer interest and profits in 2021. Axie Infinity (AXS) took the lead by introducing the concept and practice of play-to-earn games.</p>\n<p>In combination with enhanced graphics and improved game-play, this produced an upswing in the demand for crypto games. In play-to-earn games, players can earn tokens during the game that they can change for cash on a cryptocurrency exchange.</p>\n<p>After Facebook decided to rebrand its platform as Meta, virtual worlds attracted the spotlight. This was noteworthy, although metaverses have been achieving prominence for some time. So far, it is not known whether they will be decentralized or if corporations will have a strong presence in this space. Yet, since cryptos are favored for payment in the metaverse, cryptocurrencies will most likely have a role in this innovative trend.</p>\n<h3>2. 2022 Arrival of Next-Generation Internet</h3>\n<p>The next-generation Internet, Web 3, will be introduced in its formative stages in 2022. In this decentralized web space, users will reap benefits for sharing their time, posting comments and messages, or creating groups and communities. Although its implications are more extensive, Web 3 has connections to gaming and metaverses.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness and stability of Web 3 are currently unknown. Some Internet users view Web 3 as an opportunity for web users to disconnect from the big corporate entities that now dominate social media networks and web browsing. Yet the currency market and participants will use this next-generation Internet to take control of their data and to gain tokens for participating.</p>\n<p>The large companies will most likely remain as prominent web presences, at least for a while. This is because they are focused on staying relevant and highly visible. Yet, for crypto investors, this is a major event to stay informed about. Ultimately, all factors relevant to Web 3 should be carefully watched and assessed by savvy investors today.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<h3>3. Greater Regulation and Government Action</h3>\n<p>Worldwide attention was focused on the crypto market in 2021. From the acceptance of Bitcoin for legal tender by El Salvador to China’s actions to ban cryptocurrencies, global reactions to the use of cryptos have gained attention. Yet no government can continue to ignore cryptocurrencies and have a strong influence or participation in worldwide commerce and finance.</p>\n<p>Predictions are that governments may take action in the following ways:</p>\n<ul><li>Specific Regulations on Stablecoin. Cryptocurrencies that are connected to another commodity like the U.S. dollar or gold are termed “stablecoins.” Yet some regulators have concerns about the way that some coins are backed. Another concern is whether backers have sufficient reserves to sustain a run on a particular coin. As a result, there will most likely be new rulings in early 2022.</li><li>More Regulation of Cryptos. Global governments are now working on ways to initiate more excellent investor protection while preventing the hindrance of the operations of the whole cryptocurrencies industry. All of the talks on this critical subject that took place in 2021 will most likely turn into action during 2022.</li><li>Central Bank Introduction of Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Different global governments are exploring the advantages of introducing their own “govcoins,” or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_digital_currency">CBDCs</a>, like a digital dollar. These govcoins would be backed by the central banks of countries and by their governments. For example, China has nearly finalized its digital yuan pilot scheme.</li></ul>\n<h3>4.

Here\'s an overview of cryptocurrency trends.</p><div>\n<p>Cryptocurrencies have been among the most talked-about technological trends in the last few years. As with most other vital trends before the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic, digital assets gained popularity as crypto experienced continued adoption throughout different sectors of the economy.</p>\n<p>The economic lockdowns due to the pandemic accelerated the digital currency transformation that made 2021 a remarkable year for cryptocurrencies. 2022 is likely to continue witnessing significant achievements and breakthroughs that will see cryptocurrency redefine the future of finance as new developments emerge daily.</p>\n<h2>Will crypto rise again?</h2>\n<p>Cryptocurrencies have been the subject of hot debate in the world of finance since they were first introduced. The market’s potential has not gone unnoticed despite naysayers’ claims that it is unreliable and volatile. As cryptos have gained acceptance over the years, many larger financial institutions are becoming more interested in this sector. Despite some highs and lows since its inception, many experts anticipate a resurgence soon. While such an investment carries a certain level of risk, if handled with caution, it may just be on the verge of another notable rise.</p>\n<h2>1. Improving Usability of Cryptocurrencies</h2>\n<p>If you own any form of cryptocurrency, you want to become part of the emerging future and enjoy the first-mover advantage; you need to know the leading crypto trends to make more informed investment decisions. The following are top cryptocurrency trends you ought to follow:</p>\n<h3>Crypto backed loans</h3>\n<p>If you have a project you are pursuing or have an emergency, you can take a cryptocurrency-backed loan similar to any other secured loan. Instead of using your home or car as collateral, you can place your digital assets as security and borrow some cash.</p>\n<p>Smartcredit.io peer-to-peer lending platform facilitates the provision of loans between users. Some advantages associated with taking cryptocurrency-backed loans include the lack of an international barrier. Unlike fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies operate globally, meaning a borrower can avail financial partnerships with<a href="https://smartcredit.io/crypto-loans/"> crypto-backed lenders</a> from just about anywhere in the world.</p>\n<h3>Earning interest on cryptocurrencies</h3>\n<p>There’s always the temptation to hold on and hope that prices will appreciate for most people who own some cryptocurrency. However, instead of just sitting on your crypto holdings, the better thing to do is to avoid simply banking on higher prices but rather act as a bank yourself.</p>\n<p>You can earn a tremendous interest by lending your digital assets to interested borrowers who’ll return them with interest. Similar to what banks and brokerage firms do, lending crypto through collateralized loans backed by clients’ securities is an ingenious way to use your digital assets.</p>\n<h3>Crypto staking</h3>\n<p>Staking refers to a method where you earn rewards or interest when you lock down your crypto for a certain amount of time. If you own cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/smartcredit-token/">SMARTCREDIT</a>\xa0you earn a passive income on your holdings by committing them to support a blockchain in addition to confirming transactions.</p>\n<p>Staking usually happens through a staking pool comparable to an interest-bearing savings account. In most cases, you could earn anywhere between 5 and 20 percent annually on the crypto assets you have staked. You earn because the blockchain will put your crypto holdings to work using a consensus mechanism called proof-of-stake that ensures all transactions are secure and verified.</p>\n<h3>Yield Farming</h3>\n<p>Yield farming is yet another popular trend in cryptocurrency investment that involves lending out digital assets to decentralized exchanges, thus contributing to their liquidity pools and earning interest on it in return. This is a highly lucrative project that offers high-interest rates, which in some cases could reach an annual percentage yield (APY) of over 100%.</p>\n<p>APY refers to the annual interest you can earn on a deposit, with records showing cases where people have made over 1000% returns. Since the interest in paid in crypto, the earnings will depend on the value of your cryptocurrency of choice.</', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

So far, we have witnessed the emergence of a range of new use cases for crypto-class assets. Moreover, we have seen the governments of many nations become more open to the possibilities provided by the crypto economy. But of course, there is so much more still to be discovered!</p>\n<p>Before we dive right into some of the upcoming, new crypto trends to keep an eye on in 2022, it is crucial to stress the importance of understanding and becoming familiar with these trends.</p>\n<p>Understanding crypto trends is essential for making informed decisions as an individual or a corporate organization. For instance, as a company that renders crypto-related services, it is viable to project or estimate a specific result based on existing and upcoming trends, as well as the data associated with each one.</p>\n<p>For instance, it can be justifiably predicted that there will be an increase in metaverse adoption simply by noting the trend of corporate adoption in the space; seeing the likes of Disney, Nike, Adidas, etc, joining the metaverse craze makes it realistic to predict a surge in corporate adoption in the coming years.</p>\n<p>In addition to facilitating informed decisions, trends also enable individuals and organizations to set realistic goals and objectives when planning or mapping out a project, campaign, or related activities.</p>\n<p>Trends can further be addressed as a continual measure of progress in the space, since they allow individuals and corporate organizations to track the space’s development, while also using them as a key metric for determining long-term viability, especially where scalability is of major concern.

The truth is that the year of 2021 was a defining moment for the entire crypto ecosystem. It represented a moment of truth for every stakeholder, from Governments, regulators, and developers, down to the end-users. But what was so special about 2021? You may ask.\xa0</p>\n<p>To begin with, the fourth quarter of 2021 saw a significant increase in global crypto adoption, with the number of users rising from the slightly over 100 million recorded in the fourth quarter (ending December) of 2020, to nearly 300 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, representing an <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1202503/global-cryptocurrency-user-base/">increase of nearly 200%</a> over the course of a single year.\xa0</p>\n<p>The figure also implies that, in 2021, the total number of new crypto users outnumber those who joined the space in the preceding 12 years following the first cryptocurrency going public.

But valuations are creeping into the danger zone</h2></section><div><div><p>BRUCE WASSERSTEIN was probably the most famous mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) banker on Wall Street in the 1980s and 1990s. Yet “Bid ‘em up Bruce”, who died in 2009, was ambivalent about his trade. The best rainmakers were capable men, he once wrote, but dealmaking also attracted “hustlers and swaggering mediocrities”. And whereas takeovers made the business world more dynamic, they also led to “pain, dislocations and blunders”.</p><p>Whether dealmaking is sensible is once more an important question, because M&amp;A are back with a vengeance, after a lull following the financial crisis. Worldwide, $3.6 trillion of deals have been announced this year, reckons Bloomberg, an information provider, approaching the peak reached in 2007. In pharmaceuticals (see <a href="/business/2014/11/15/invent-it-swap-it-or-buy-it">article</a>) and among media firms the activity is frantic. Deals worth more than $10 billion are again common. America and Britain, with their open markets for corporate control, account for a disproportionate share of the action. So do cross-border deals, which have risen from a sixth of activity in the mid-1990s to 43% today.</p><p>Long experience of booms and slumps in M&amp;A has made investors wary. Veteran fund managers and academics argue that deals satisfy executives’ vanity and enrich their bankers, but destroy value for shareholders. Reflecting this worry, when a firm announces an acquisition its shares have tended to fall, as investors fret that the premium it is paying will exceed the benefit from the synergies it will reap. However, since 2012 acquirers’ share prices have generally been stable or have risen, according to McKinsey, a consulting firm. That begs an intriguing and dangerous question. Might this time be different?</p><p>On paper, M&amp;A make sense. When two firms combine they can cut duplicated overheads, raising their margins. By adding together their market shares they can gain pricing power over customers and suppliers. By cross-selling each other’s product ranges in each other’s geographic markets, merging firms can make their combined sales a lot bigger than the sum of their individual ones.</p><p>M&amp;A folklore, however, dwells on giant catastrophes, such as the combinations of Time Warner and AOL in 2000 just as the dotcom bubble burst, or Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and ABN AMRO in 2007, as the subprime crisis struck. Yet some of the world’s most successful firms are the result of giant deals. Exxon became the energy industry’s top dog thanks to its purchase in 1999 of Mobil, which had an under-appreciated collection of global assets. AB Inbev has done $100 billion of deals over two decades to become the world’s biggest brewer, with thirst-quenching profits.</p><p>In any case smaller, and probably less risky, deals account for most activity—ones worth less than $5 billion have accounted for two-thirds of total deal volumes over the past decade. Today’s huge multinationals are constantly bolting on new businesses, in transactions that are often barely noticed. General Electric, Google and Intel have between them bought more than 500 firms in the past five years.</p><p>Contrary to M&amp;A’s dire reputation most deals do in fact create value, at least in the short term: since 2000 the combined market capitalisations of buyers and target firms has typically risen when deals are announced (see chart 1). The problem is that, all too often, over 100% of these gains has accrued to the shareholders of the firm being bought. Typically the acquirer overpays for the synergies on offer, exaggerates or overestimates them in its lust to justify a deal, or botches the subsequent integration of the organisations. M&amp;A are cyclical and the worst deals happen at the top.</p><div><figure><div><p></p></div></figure><p>Why might the benefits of M&amp;A be more evenly spread between targets and acquirers this time round?

However, others, including major banking giants like <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/outlook-2023-us-expected-to-escape-recession.html">Goldman Sachs</a>, feel that the U.S., in particular, will avoid the economic downturn, with only 35 percent of their analysts thinking there will be a recession — much lower than most other economists. Despite this, it remains clear that most figures of influence in the economic sphere <a href="https://theweek.com/economy/1017604/a-us-recession-in-the-next-12-months-is-effectively-certain">see a recession looming</a> on the horizon in the new year.

Economists expect the wild cards for 2020 to point in one direction: downward.</p>\n<p>“[D]ownside risks seem to dominate the outlook,” noted the IMF in its latest <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2019/10/01/world-economic-outlook-october-2019">big report</a> on the global economy’s prospects.

Global economic growth is expected to further slow, while cities will witness subdued consumer spending growth. Commodity prices are likely to soften and global supply chains will recover, but upside risks on inflation will remain. Food and beverages and pharmaceuticals are sectors that are expected to be resilient, while the outlook for energy-intensive industries remains challenging.</p>\n<p>Below is a summary of some key trends in the global economy, cities, business environment, industrial production and commodities market for businesses to consider in 2023.</p>\n<p>Global Economies Landscape in 2023<br /><em><sup>Source: Euromonitor International Macro Model/ ILO/National statistics/ Eurostat/UN/OECD</sup></em><br /><em><sup>Note: Data for 2022 and beyond are forecasts.</sup></em></p>\n<h3><strong>A new economic reality shaped by geopolitical tensions, high inflation and rising interest rates </strong></h3>\n<p><em>Maxim Hofer – Senior Economies Consultant</em></p>\n<p>Businesses and consumers will face a challenging economic setting in 2023: global real GDP growth is expected to slow further to 2.3%. Meanwhile, a new economic reality is arising, characterised by a multitude of challenges, risks and crises that will result in an unusually high level of uncertainty. Sharply reduced purchasing power and a rapidly changing interest rate environment will further dampen business and consumer confidence. Rising geopolitical tensions could result in immediate economic shocks, while also raising the potential of broader shifts in global trade. Advanced economies are forecast to grow by 0.7% in real terms in 2023, driven by high recession risks in the US and Europe. Emerging and developing economies are expected to grow by 3.7% in the same year, with some outperformers in Asia Pacific and the Middle East.</p>\n<h3><strong>Labour market tightness likely to continue, despite potential increase in unemployment</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Lan Ha – Head of Economies Practice</em></p>\n<p>Entering 2023, the impact of near-term pandemic-related factors (health concerns, declining immigration, changing work preferences) that led to tight labour markets in previous years will ease. Economic slowdown could also reduce the demand for workers and result in higher unemployment rates in some countries. However, several existing structural changes will keep the global labour market tight. Among the main issues are the rapid ageing of workforces in advanced and some large emerging markets, as well as political and other risks to labour force migration, thus restricting overall labour supply. A tight labour market will continue to push up nominal wage growth, adding to inflation risks and pressures on companies’ costs. Businesses in 2023 will thus still face the challenges of attracting and retaining workers, prompting the need for investment in human capital, organisational adjustment and productivity enhancement.<br /><em><sup>Source: Euromonitor International from national statistics/UN/OECD/Eurostat</sup></em><br /><em><sup>Note: Data from 2022 are forecasts</sup></em></p>\n<h3><strong>Urban consumer spending to be curbed by inflation and cost of living crisis</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Fransua Vytautas Razvadauskas – Senior Cities Consultant</em></p>\n<p>High inflation and economic instability will curb urban consumer spending in 2023, as people will continue to direct more of their incomes to cover necessities such as food and utilities. This will challenge those cities where the local economy heavily depends on leisure, recreation and accommodation services, with tourism-focused cities such as Athens and Bangkok feeling the pressure of reduced inbound consumer spending. On the other hand, cities in Asian and Middle Eastern and African urban areas are expected to see resilient growth in consumer spending due to solid demand-side growth, with 4.2% and 2.5% year-on-year real growth being forecast, respectively, for 2023.</p>\n<p><em><sup></sup></em><em><sup>Source: Euromonitor International from national statistics/OECD/UN/International Monetary Fund (IMF), International Financial Statistics (IFS)<br /></sup><sup>Note: Data from 2022 are forecasts.</sup></em></p>\n<p><strong>Commodities price pressure to ease, but volatility remains</', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

The variable inflation-indexed rate for I bonds bought from November 2022 through April 2023 will indeed be 6.48% as predicted. Every single I bond will also earn this rate eventually for 6 months, depending on the initial purchase month. The fixed rate for I bonds bought from November 2022 through April 2023 will be 0.40% (up from zero, and right in the midpoint of my guess), for a composite rate of 6.89% for 6 months. Still a good deal, either buying now or in January when the purchase limits reset.</p>\n<p>See you again in mid-April for the next early prediction for May 2023.</p>\n<p>Original post 10/13/22:</p>\n<p><strong>Inflation still 🚀 😬</strong> Savings I Bonds are a unique, low-risk investment backed by the US Treasury that pay out a variable interest rate linked to inflation. With a holding period from 12 months to 30 years, you could own them as an alternative to bank certificates of deposit (they are liquid after 12 months) or bonds in your portfolio. </p>\n<p>New inflation numbers were just announced at <a href="http://bls.gov/">BLS.gov</a>, which allows us to make an early prediction of the November 2022 savings bond rates a couple of weeks before the official announcement on the 1st. <strong>This also allows the opportunity to know exactly what a October 2022 savings bond purchase will yield over the next 12 months, instead of just 6 months.</strong> You can then compare this against a November 2022 purchase.</p>\n<p><strong>New inflation rate prediction.</strong> March 2022 CPI-U was 287.504. September 2022 CPI-U was 296.808, for a semi-annual increase of 3.24%. Using the <a href="https://www.mymoneyblog.com/how_to_predict_1.html">official formula</a>, the variable component of interest rate for the next 6 month cycle will be <strong>6.48%</strong>. You add the fixed and variable rates to get the total interest rate. The fixed rate hasn’t been above 0.50% in over a decade, but if you have an older savings bond, your fixed rate may be up to 3.60%.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips on purchase and redemption.</strong> You can’t redeem until after 12 months of ownership, and any redemptions within 5 years incur an interest penalty of the last 3 months of interest. A simple “trick” with I-Bonds is that if you buy at the end of the month, you’ll still get all the interest for the entire month – same as if you bought it in the beginning of the month. It’s best to give yourself a few business days of buffer time. If you miss the cutoff, your effective purchase date will be bumped into the next month.</p>\n<p><strong>Buying in October 2022.</strong> If you buy before the end of October, the fixed rate portion of I-Bonds will be 0%. You will be guaranteed a total interest rate of 0.00 + 9.62 = <strong>9.62% for the next 6 months</strong>. For the 6 months after that, the total rate will be 0.00 + 6.48 = <strong>6.48% for the subsequent 6 months</strong>. </p>\n<p>Let’s look at a worst-case scenario, where you hold for the minimum of one year and pay the 3-month interest penalty. If you theoretically buy on October 31st, 2022 and sell on October 1st, 2023, you’ll earn a <strong>~7.01% annualized return for an 11-month holding period</strong>, for which the interest is also exempt from state income taxes.

Here's What We Learned Today from the Fed", 'https://www.investopedia.com/where-will-cd-rates-go-in-2024-here-s-what-we-learned-today-from-the-fed-7972304', '<div><div>\n<p>\nThe Federal Reserve\'s announcement on interest rates was no surprise today—but it provided a set of clues we only receive from the Fed once per quarter, suggesting where savings and CD rates could be headed for the rest of this year and into 2024. For CD shoppers trying to decide when to lock in a great rate and what certificate duration to choose, any possible signals from the Fed are worth pondering. So let\'s see what we learned.\n</p>\n<h2> What the Fed\'s 2023 Expectations Mean for CD Rates </h2>\n<p>\nWhat the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp">Federal Reserve</a> does with the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp">federal funds rate</a> has a direct impact on the interest banks and credit unions are willing to pay for savings, money market, and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp">certificate of deposit (CD)</a> accounts. So when the fed funds rate goes up, bank rates go up as well. The same is true when the Fed lowers its benchmark rate.\n</p>\n<p>\nToday\'s move by the Federal Reserve was actually a non-move. As was widely expected, the central bank <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/fed-holds-interest-rate-flat-but-future-hikes-still-on-the-table-7972170">held the fed funds rate steady</a>, after most recently raising it on July 26. Across the last 13 meetings—beginning in March 2022—the Fed has raised its benchmark rate 11 times. That\'s resulted in a cumulative increase of 5.25% so far, and has taken the Fed rate to its highest level since 2001.<br />\n</p>\n<p>\nBut once every three months, the Fed\'s rate-setting committee releases some extra "behind the curtain" information, including the eagerly anticipated "<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/dot-plot-4581755">dot plot</a>". This chart represents each committee member with a dot (with no names attached) and uses those dots to show where each member believes the fed funds rate will be at the end of 2023, 2024, and so on.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the dot plot released today, we learned that almost two-thirds of the Fed members (12 out of 19) believe the benchmark rate will need to be raised one more time in 2023, for another increase of 0.25%. All of the remaining seven members instead believe the rate will hold where it is through the rest of the year.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the majority proves right, it would mean another rate increase on either Nov. 1 or Dec. 13. And this in turn could nudge CD rates a bit higher. It\'s also true that if an increase becomes widely expected, some banks and credit unions could raise rates ahead of the actual Fed announcement.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut beware: These are just predictions, based on what the Fed members know right now. The economic landscape can change quickly, which means the Fed can change course from previous projections.\n</p>\n<h2> What Does the Fed Predict for 2024? </h2>\n<p>\nWhat we can gather from the dot plot about the direction of rates in 2024 is a little fuzzier, given the more distant time horizon. The biggest point of agreement among Fed members is that there will be rate cuts in 2024. Roughly 70% of the committee members (13 out of 19) believe the fed funds rate will be lowered by the end of 2024. However, the amount of decline they project varies between 0.25% and 1.00%. The median expectation is a drop of 0.50% in 2024.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe other reason this projection is a little less concrete than 2023\'s forecast is that the dot plot doesn\'t convey any timing of rate changes other than the calendar year. So while it seems likely that one or more rate decreases will be implemented in 2024, the dot plot provides no information on which of next year\'s eight meetings we should expect the cuts.\n', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

In fact, the general consensus is that interest rates are unlikely to go up or down prior to the second quarter of 2024.\xa0</p><h2>So what</h2><p>The Federal has raised interest rates 11 times since March of 2022 in an effort to cool inflation. And its effort has been paying off.</p><p>In June of 2022, annual inflation peaked at 9.1% as per that month\'s Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the cost of consumer goods and services. By comparison, in August of 2022, annual inflation was measured at 3.7% by the CPI.\n</p><p>But while inflation levels have receded, the Fed\'s ultimate goal is to get the CPI down to 2% on an annual basis. It\'s this level, the central bank feels, that\'s most conducive to long-term economic stability. As such, the Fed is unlikely to cut rates until inflation gets closer to that mark. If anything, it may decide to raise rates one more time in 2023.\n</p><p>"Though we continue to expect the Fed to remain on hold at the Sept. 20 FOMC meeting, we would not be surprised to see most officials continue to project one more rate hike by year-end in their updated \'dot plot,\'" said Brett Ryan, senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, referring to the interest rate projections released by Federal Reserve policymakers on a quarterly basis.</p><h2>Now what</h2><p>Many consumers are eagerly waiting for the Fed to cut interest rates so that borrowing becomes more affordable.

One of the key determinants of real interest rates are nominal interest rates. Within today’s article, we’ll examine the Fed monetary policy turns – just how did they affect the broad debt markets? The long-term interest rates are flashing a valuable signal for us, gold investors.</p>\n<p>As the Fed turned dovish this year, not only did the short-term interest rates move down - the long- and very-long-term ones also declined. Why would this be the case? After all, the long-term rates are set by market forces, not through Fed\'s direct decision... More importantly, though, why should you, the precious metals investor, care? What kind of signal does it send to the gold market for the following months and years?</p>\n<p>It\'s not that the Fed directly controls the long-term rates that is the issue here - it doesn\'t.</p>\n<p>The long-term interest rates are based on supply and demand, which are in turn based on market expectations. After all, markets are\xa0<strong>forward looking</strong>.\xa0</p>\n<p>And what does the Fed provide in addition to interest rate decisions?\xa0<a href="https://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/dictionary/gold-forward-guidance/"><strong>Forward guidance</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Year after year, public debts have been increasing across the world\'s most advanced economies, and it\'s becoming increasingly obvious that this debt cannot be repaid using regular revenue of the official sector (taxes). The <a href="https://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/dictionary/federal-debt-gold/">debt</a> can be repudiated but that\'s an unthinkable proposition - take a look at how Greece\'s efforts turned out. Realistically, the <a href="https://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/dictionary/sovereign-debt-crisis-gold/">debt</a> will need to be inflated away... Or maybe it won\'t have to be. After all, in the scenario where long-term interest rates go below zero, the debt is no longer ballooning due to interest. Either way, the interest rates are likely to be lower in the long run based on the above. This is the core of financial repression - artificially low rates. But that\'s just one of the reasons.\xa0</p>\n<p>The direct comments from the Fed clearly support the above - the rates are getting lower and that\'s happening even without incoming data that would support a rate cut. All the talk about the Fed being data-driven didn\'t amount to much after Trump started openly criticizing Fed and demanding rates be cut. He delivered the "trade risk" which served as justification of a rate cut. That\'s not an official statistic the Fed was supposed to follow - it\'s smoke and mirrors that helps to keep rates in a long-term downtrend. Then, it\'s no wonder that forward-looking investors expect rates to be lower in the following years, not only months. What does it imply for gold? In the very long term it\'s very bullish, because when the risk-free rate goes to (or below) zero, an asset that doesn\'t yield any interest becomes much more desirable. In normal circumstances, it\'s better to have an interest-yielding asset than one without. But when the long-term interest rates go below zero and investors can\'t earn money through bonds, gold will be a much better alternative. Especially when it outshines inflation.\xa0</p>\n<p>The key thing to keep in mind is that the above is a long-term fundamental factor. It doesn\'t tell us where the market will move either in the short term or in the medium term. It\'s practically a factor of zero importance for day trading.\xa0</p>\n<p>The markets are forward looking, which means that they are already discounting the above taking place and they aim to front run the obvious consequences even before they occur. The markets discount more than news and fundamentals, though. They also discount investors and traders\' emotions for people tend to get ahead of themselves in terms of expectations and reactions to news.

Also, local stock exchanges may not offer <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidmarket.asp">liquid markets</a> to outside investors.\n</p>\n<p>\nEmerging markets generally do not have as highly developed market and regulatory institutions as those found in developed nations. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketefficiency.asp">Market efficiency</a> and strict standards in accounting and securities regulation are generally not on par with advanced economies (such as those of the United States, Europe, and Japan).\n</p>\n<h3> Signs of Progress </h3>\n<p>\nHowever, emerging markets typically have a physical financial <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/infrastructure.asp">infrastructure</a>, including banks, a stock exchange, and a unified currency. A key aspect of emerging market economies is that over time, they adopt reforms and institutions like those of modern developed countries. This promotes economic growth.\n</p>\n<p>\nEmerging market economies tend to move away from activities focused on agricultural and resource extraction toward industrial and manufacturing activities. Their governments usually pursue deliberate industrial and trade strategies to encourage <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp">economic growth</a> and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industrialization.', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

From the start of 2022 through early August, the four largest technology companies lost an average of 14% of their value, including dividends, compared with a decline of 12% for the benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index. (Prices, returns and other data are as of Aug. 5 unless otherwise noted.)</p><p>The four biggest tech firms also happen to be the biggest U.S. companies of any kind, as measured by market capitalization (price times shares outstanding).

None has abandoned its original business, but all have moved into other sectors. Those transitions have been impressive and nearly unique among corporations. The flexibility that the Mega Four have displayed bodes well for future adaptation to changing markets.</p><p>For example, every one of the four is a leader in the supremely profitable business of cloud computing, which lets users store massive amounts of data remotely and securely, accessible anywhere in the world. Three-fourths of Amazon\'s profits last year came from its cloud-computing unit. For the quarter ending June 30, Microsoft\'s Intelligent Cloud revenue represented 39% of total sales for the company; Alphabet\'s cloud revenues jumped 35% in the same quarter.</p><p>Even Apple, a manufacturing company, understands the value of cloud computing. Revenues from the company\'s services division, which in addition to the cloud includes Apple TV+, Apple Music, the Apple Card and the App Store, are growing three times as fast as iPhone sales. Forbes predicts profits from services will reach $50 billion a year, surpassing the profits from iPhone sales, by 2025.</p><p>All the companies are using a subscription model, the best example being Amazon Prime, to guarantee a flow of cash.

But back then, inflation was well below the Fed’s target. Now inflation is raging <em>well above</em> the Fed’s target.</p>\n<p>So since the end of this summer’s bear-market rally on August 16, the S&amp;P 500 Index has dropped 16.7% and the Nasdaq has dropped 19.5%, both of them just barely above the February 2020 levels.</p>\n<p>Many of the stocks on my list of <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/category/all/imploded-stocks/">Imploded Stocks</a> have plunged by 50% or more over the same period, to carve out new lows after having shot up by 100% over the prior weeks – such as Carvana [<a href="https://wolfstreet.com/stock/cvna">CVNA</a>] which roundtripped from $20 on July 14, to $54.59 on August 16, and back to $20.30 on Friday, September 30.

(436, 'Wealth Daily', 'https://www.wealthdaily.com/resources/7-strategies-for-tech-investing/52014', '<div><div><p>Investing in technology is unlike investing in any other sector. In this space, competition runs rampant, and products become obsolete in a matter of months.</p><p>The presence of these dynamic qualities means conventional investing strategies don\'t always apply. It\'s therefore important to tweak our approach and follow a slightly different set of rules...</p><p>Below, you\'ll find our top seven strategies tailored specifically to investing in this space.</p><h3><strong>1. Forget What You Know About Valuation</strong></h3><p>Technology is about growth, innovation, and opportunity — not P/E, assets vs. liabilities, or debt-to-equity ratios. Of course, these metrics will matter at some point, but by the time they do, the company in question is likely already on its way out of what we consider to be the true technology sector.</p><p>Take <strong>Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)</strong>, for example. While historically (and still widely) considered a technology company, it no longer helps us as investors to place Apple in that category.</p><p>When the company was introducing innovative products the world had never seen before, it was still what we would consider a true tech company.</p><p>But for the last half-decade, Apple has been a producer of consumer goods more than anything else. The company found a line of products that sell incredibly well and began to play it safe. Innovation slowed, and so did investor gains. Gradually, it became less important to look at Apple\'s future as an innovator and more important to look at its PEG ratio.</p><p>When we talk about the technology sector, we\'re talking about companies with innovative and unique products, new ideas, and the potential to grow into something huge. You wouldn\'t judge an infant by her SAT scores, and you shouldn\'t rank a tech stock based on standard valuation metrics.</p><h3><strong>2. Focus on Growth Metrics</strong></h3><p>In line with putting conventional valuation aside, we place a large focus on factors that are either a sign of or contribute to the growth rate. Here are a few key metrics to look for:</p><ul><li><strong>Historical Growth Rate:</strong> Compare long-term growth rates to short-term growth rates. If there is a consistent uptrend in revenue when approaching more recent time intervals, that\'s great news for a tech stock.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> This measures the rate of return on shareholder interest. Compare a company\'s ROE to that of its peers.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Earnings per Share (EPS):</strong> Like ROE, EPS is a measure of profitability. But instead of just comparing to industry peers, look at growth in EPS over time, as you would do with revenue.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Debt to Earnings:</strong> As a rule of thumb, we want debt to be no more than five times annual earnings.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Margins:</strong> Margins should be greater than the industry average and should improve over time.</li></ul><h3><strong>3. Know What\'s Trending</strong></h3><p>The media will sometimes promote an industry or even a specific company as "the next big thing."

What’s next?', 'https://www.realtrends.com/articles/a-soft-landing-for-the-real-estate-market-whats-next/', '<div><article>\n\t<div>\n\t\n<p>About this time last summer, I said\xa0 it looked like the U.S. housing market could have a soft landing in 2023. Any time you use the phrase “soft landing” it should come with a trigger warning because some folks get really angry hearing it. But, I think it’s pretty indisputable now that we got a soft landing.\xa0</p>\n<p>The market was roaring — way too hot — with bidding wars, speculators and investors who thought they couldn’t lose. A soft landing is how you end that crazy cycle without the massive pain of a market crash or bubble burst.</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2022 after mortgage rates jumped to 7.5%, I thought maybe we’d missed the soft landing call. By October 2022, it looked like 2023 would have rising inventory and falling home prices. I grew pretty bearish again. But since <a href="https://www.realtrends.com/articles/altos-research-hopeful-signs-for-2023-housing-market/">January,</a> home buyers have defied all expectations. Sellers have not materialized, and buyers have been buying everything that becomes available. Inventory has fallen all year. The peak of inventory for 2023 so far was the week of the New Year — that is insane. While home prices fell in July and September 2022, they’ve largely recovered now.</p>\n<p>Three of the four <a href="https://www.altosresearch.com/">Altos</a> price measures are now showing positive data compared to 2022. The median price of the homes in contract is higher than last year and the new sales each week are up a few percent over last year. This is what a soft landing looks like. The froth is out of the market. There was no crash.\xa0</p>\n<p>Could the market crash from here in the future? Of course, it could. Buyers are very sensitive, so if inflation reheats, unemployment spikes and <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/mortgage-rates/">mortgage rates jump again,</a> then the economy fails at its soft landing and craters hard. We could see inventory from distressed sellers emerge in 2025. But that’s a long way out. So right now — soft landing.</p>\n<h2>Price</h2>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>The median price of all single-family homes on the market in the U.S. is $450,000. That’s essentially unchanged from 2022. It is just a few hundred bucks lower. In the dark red line above, the data shows how rapidly home prices were adjusting lower starting in July 2022. This year, prices are past their annual peak and will decline, but in a few weeks, it looks like the market will be up year over year.\xa0</p>\n<p>The median price of the newly listed cohort — all the homes that hit the market in the last week — is about $410,000. That’s higher than in 2022 at this time. Last year if you listed your home in July, you priced at a discount because there were no buyers. But buyers are present this year, so prices are not up year over year. In the light red line on this chart, the data shows the rapid price decline of the new listings in the second half of 2022. That seasonal decline will be less steep this year, so annual prices will increase more as the year progresses.\xa0</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>I’ve been watching the price of the new pending sales each week. This statistic is really compelling as a leading indicator of future sales. The median price of the new pending sales this week is $379,000. That’s down from last week but you can see how the home sales each week now are consistently higher priced than they were in 2022. The dark red line is the weekly curve from this year. The light red line is the curve of last year. Look at those big buyer discounts in July and September of 2022.\xa0\xa0</p>\n<p>When I talk about a soft landing, this is where you can really see how it could get derailed. Buyers are sensitive to big jumps in mortgage rates. If I’m getting ready to buy a house, and mortgage rates jump in a week, I either hold off, or', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

At one point her search even veered east to Oshawa, although she wished to be near friends downtown.</p><p>Finally this summer, thanks to the downturn in the real estate market, the 37-year-old marketing professional achieved her dream of becoming a homeowner. Beckett was able to buy a 1920, semi-detached fixer-upper walking distance to the subway, for under $700,000. She is in love with the original maple staircase.</p><p>“I did not think it was possible. I really thought I would be stuck in a condo when I set out. This was my pipe dream — that I would own a house,” she said.</p><p>GTA home prices have yet to hit bottom, say economists and real estate experts. That means buyers like Beckett, who struggled through the pandemic housing frenzy, still have an opportunity this fall to get into the market.</p><p>But given the lowest inventories in decades and climbing interest rates, it’s probably a limited window in the most uncertain market the GTA has seen in years. </p><p>Since prices began declining in March, some buyers have been able to purchase a property that would have been beyond their means last winter. At the same time, sellers have been distressed to learn their house or condo just won’t sell for what the neighbours’ fetched weeks or months earlier.</p><p>Patience and timing were big factors in Beckett’s success, said her realtor, James Frodyma, of Dave Elfassy Sutton Group-Admiral Realty brokerage.</p><p>The house was originally listed for $799,900 and reduced to $699,999. Beckett said the sellers had already moved to a new home. She negotiated a price of $672,500 with conditions and a frantic, two-week closing.</p><p>Predictions of how the housing market will play out this fall range dramatically.

There are even huge variations by neighbourhoods so that right now some popular areas are still attracting bidding wars.</p><p>Right at Home Realty president John Lusink said he’s not ready to call the GTA a buyer’s market even though he expects home values to drop another eight- to 10 per cent this fall, returning values to 2019 levels. His reasoning — desirable properties in the right neighbourhoods are still attracting multiple offers.</p><p>He does see a surge on the rental side of the market. In a typical September, about 28 per cent of Right at Home transactions would be leases. Last week, it was edging up to 40 per cent.</p><p>Sales have seen a corresponding drop and an increased number of transactions are struggling to close as buyers have to qualify at higher mortgage rates. The Ratehub.ca website shows lenders are offering five-year fixed loans at about 4.5- to 5 per cent compared to a historic low of 1.39 per cent in February 2021.</p><p>“You’re seeing a whole group of buyers who may have been at their max, now relegated to going back into the rental market,” said Lusink.</p><p>Re/Max is forecasting a 6.3 per cent drop in GTA home prices this fall, as consumers grapple with rising rates, inflation and fears of a recession, and a two- to 10 per cent drop across Ontario.

Mortgage lenders and borrowers should expect rising mortgage rates over the next year, as stronger economic growth pushes Treasury yields higher, said Mike Fratantoni, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association at their 2001 Annual Convention &amp; Expo in October.<em><strong>5</strong></em> \xa0 <strong>However, it’s important to keep in mind that even a 4% mortgage rate is low when compared to historical standards.</strong>\xa0</p>\n<p>According to industry trade blog The Mortgage Reports<i>,</i> “Between 1971 and December 2020, 30-year mortgage rates averaged 7.89%.”<em><strong>6</strong></em> \xa0</p>\n<p><b>What does it mean for you?</b></p>\n<p>Low mortgage rates can reduce your monthly payment and make homeownership more affordable.

The real estate market typically slows down in the fall and winter. But economists also suspect a fundamental shift in supply and demand. \xa0 At the National Association of Realtors’ annual conference last November, the group’s chief economist, Lawrence Yun, told attendees that he expects increased supply to come from an uptick in new construction—which is already underway—and an end to the mortgage forbearance program. “With more housing inventory to hit the market, the intense multiple offers will start to ease,” he said.<em><strong>', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Economists say rising <a href="https://money.com/freddie-mac-mortgage-rates/?ref=/home-price-forecasts-boom-over/">mortgage rates</a> are now causing a <a href="https://money.com/housing-market-correction-federal-reserve/?ref=/home-price-forecasts-boom-over/">housing slowdown</a> that could reverse the upward movement in home prices, or at least slow price growth down.</p>\n <p>Between May 2020 and May 2022, U.S. home prices increased by more than 40%, according to real estate brokerage <a href="https://www.redfin.com/us-housing-market">Redfin</a>. Buyers found themselves in bidding wars and homes were selling above asking price in a matter of days. Only in the last couple months have prices started to moderate.</p>\n <p>A big cause of the shift is that it’s an expensive time to borrow money for a home, with mortgage rates creeping <a href="https://money.com/current-mortgage-rates/?ref=/home-price-forecasts-boom-over/">toward 7%</a>. This time last year, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was just under 3%.</p>\n \n <p>The increased cost of borrowing has reduced the number of buyers who can afford homes, slowing the pace of sales. However, the housing stock remains tight in many parts of the country. Homes haven’t been built and repaired fast enough to keep pace with home buying demand, and would-be sellers are thinking twice about listing their homes because they feel <a href="https://money.com/mortgage-rates-few-homes-for-sale/?ref=/home-price-forecasts-boom-over/">locked in to their current mortgages</a>. The lack of inventory is keeping the market fairly competitive, at least for now.</p>\n <p>Some housing economists are forecasting significant declines in home prices in the months ahead, while others expect prices to continue to move up — just at a slower clip.</p>\n <p>Here are five expert predictions on where home prices are headed — starting with the most bearish forecasts. The text has been lightly edited:</p>\n <h2>Mark Zandi</h2>\n <p><strong>Who he is:</strong> Chief economist at Moody’s Analytics</p>\n <p><strong>What he expects:</strong> Surging house prices at the start of this year have given way to house price declines, and further declines are likely through next year. National house prices, as measured by repeat sales indices, are on track to fall as much as 10% peak-to-trough, with the bottom likely by the end of next year.</p>\n <p><strong>His reasoning:</strong> The problem is affordability. At the currently high house prices and high and rising mortgage rates, housing is no longer affordable for potential first-time homebuyers. They are effectively locked out of the market. And existing homeowners are locked into their homes, as they can’t afford to trade their current mortgage which is at a low rate with a new mortgage at a much higher rate.</p>\n <p>All this assumes there will not be a recession. If the economy does suffer a downturn with a meaningful increase in unemployment, the peak-to-trough house price declines will be closer to 15%.</p>\n <h2>Erin Sykes</h2>\n <p><strong>Who she is:</strong> Chief economist at real estate brokerage Nest Seekers</p>\n <p><strong>What she expects:</', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

But she is bullish on a continuing draw to her market.</p>\n<p>“We have always been a destination market, especially for retirees,” she said. “Today, as the pandemic has people re-thinking their values, and/or able to work remotely, buyers from all over the country are either retiring early or buying their dream home now while mortgage rates are making them even more affordable.”</p>\n<p>Like Zide, Koberlein is actively recruiting.</p>\n<p>“We need all the dedicated agents we can get to stay on top in this busy market,” she said. “Any number of people recently let go from jobs in the hospitality industry are well-suited for independent sales - and our comprehensive new agent training is quickly getting them up to speed.”</p>\n<p>As some agents trickle back into the office while others are a bit more hesitant, Koberlein is focused on maintaining the company culture so important to the firm’s success.</p>\n<p>“I’m bringing food trucks into our parking lots during lunchtime and setting up socially distanced seating areas where agents can chat while they eat,” she said. “They are so busy, there isn’t a lot of time for that, but a great morale is the first step toward keeping up the pace we expect in the coming months.”</p>\n<p>It's a strategy endorsed by Colorado broker/owner Joe Clement, Re/Max Properties, Colorado Springs.</p>\n<p>“It’s all about the agent,” Clement said. “We began two years ago to think about shrinking our space but making better use of it.

This turbocharging of the venture world brings significant risks, from egomaniacal founders torching cash to pension pots being squandered on overvalued startups. But in the long run it also promises to make the industry more global, to funnel risk capital into a wider range of industries, and to make <small>VC</small> more accessible to ordinary investors. A larger pool of capital chasing a bigger universe of ideas will boost competition, and is likely to boost innovation, leading to a more dynamic form of capitalism.</p><p>The <small>VC</small> scene has its roots in the 1960s and has been a misfit in the financial world. In contrast to Wall Street’s suits, sophistication and Hamptons mansions, it prefers fleeces, nerdiness and Californian villas. Its distinctiveness is also a matter of intellectual emphasis. As mainstream finance has grown bigger, more quantitative and more preoccupied with slicing and dicing the cashflows of mature firms and assets, <small>VC</small> has remained a cottage industry that cuts against the grain, seeking to find and finance entrepreneurs who are too callow or strange to sit in a room with staid bankers, and ideas that are too novel for <small>MBA</small>s to capture in financial models.</p><p>The results have been striking. Despite investing relatively modest amounts over the decades, America’s <small>VC</small> funds have seeded firms that are today worth at least $18trn of the total public market. This record reflects the dizzying ascent of the big tech platforms such as Google. More recently <small>VC</small>-backed unicorns (private startups worth over $1bn) have come of age in a bonanza of public listings, ranging from the spectacular (Rivian) to the everyday (Slack). Over the past golden decade, an index of American <small>VC</small> funds has made compound annual returns of 17%. A few have done much better than that.</p><p>This success is now spilling over into the broader financial industry. As <small>VC</small>-backed firms list, the resulting windfall is being redeployed into new funds. Meanwhile, with interest rates still low, pension schemes, sovereign-wealth vehicles and companies have got a feverish dose of <small>VC</small>-envy, and are scrambling to allocate more cash to dedicated funds or setting up their own <small>VC</small> arms.

The overarching finding is that venture capital funds typically don’t outperform stocks, and that’s before getting to the fact that it is pretty much impossible to pick venture capital winners (more on that shortly). Oh, and because venture capital is riskier than investing in equities, investors oughts to get better returns than if they just bought some index funds. </p>\n<p>Mind you, this is hardly a new idea. The Economist pointed out some years ago, based on a different large-scale study, that venture capital funds only meet equity returns with a lot more fees and risks. Harvard professor Josh Lerner said as much in a 2015 presentation to CalPERS’ board, except he pointed out that to the extent the industry could claim to outperform, it was in the top 10% of the funds. Lerner insinuated that there might be a secret sauce for that; a one-time newbie on the HBS faculty had Lerner tell him how to get lucrative consulting gigs advising public pension funds on this Mission Impossible. <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2014/04/private-equity-lake-wobegon-fallacy-investors-average.html">As we wrote in 2014</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When you boil it down, this graph illustrates the ugly truth of investing in private equity: it’s not attractive unless you can outrun most of your peers investing in the asset class.</p>\n<p>Rather than question the logic of investing in private equity at all, everyone in the industry has convinced themselves that it is reasonable to believe that they can be the Warren Buffett of private equity. The investment consultants go through the shooting-fish-in-a-barrel exercise of convincing their institutional clients that each of them is prettier, smarter, and more charming than average, and therefore capable of achieving sparking results. Needless to say, flattery is an easy sell…</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, this is an intellectually dishonest exercise, and diametrically opposed to the way many public pension funds construct other parts of their investment portfolios. With public equity in particular, it’s almost certain that a significant majority of U.S. pension fund assets are invested in index funds. That’s because pension funds have recognized that, collectively, they cannot do better than average, and that after paying active management fees, actively managed public equity portfolios typically perform worse than the market average.</p>\n<p>So it’s not as if these investors are so clueless that they can’t grasp the point that all of them cannot achieve above average results, let alone significantly above average results. Instead, with private equity, there is a desperate desire to be in the asset class for reasons that probably reflect a combination of intellectual capture by the PE managers, political corruption in legislatures that control public fund board appointees, and the need to have a strategy that could conceivably solve the pension underfunding problem over time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mind you, the “see if you can out-invest your competitors” problem is more acute in venture because outperformance is concentrated in so few funds. </p>\n<p>Why are we belaboring this history before getting to a juicy paper? Because the bad facts about venture capital are, or should be, well known. But it’s just so much fun to talk to those venture capital mavens about all the great sexy things they invest in, even if the vulture, um, venture capitalists spend too much money finding and baby-sitting their charges, and most come a cropper anyhow.</p>\n<p>Now to the Financial Times article.

Luckily for both founders and their backers, conditions are not so frosty today. Startups’ balance-sheets are stronger than they were 20 years ago; valuations are not quite so detached from revenues. In America alone, venture capitalists have about <a href="/finance-and-economics/2023/01/18/venture-capitals-300bn-question">$300bn in dry powder</a>. Nonetheless, the industry that is emerging from the <a href="/business/2023/02/26/how-the-titans-of-tech-investing-are-staying-warm-over-the-vc-winter">tech slump</a> and into an era of dearer money looks different from the one that went into it.

This is a habit venture investing sometimes forgot in the boom years, when rapid growth and the hope of big profits tomorrow were prized over profits today. Many backers who were in search of a quick return piled into older, “late-stage” startups, which would probably go public soon and seemed assured of heady valuations. </p><p>Today, however, stockmarkets are volatile, making it hard for venture investors to gauge the value of late-stage startups. As interest rates have risen, lossmakers have fallen out of favour: according to an index compiled by Goldman Sachs, the stock prices of unprofitable tech companies have fallen by two-thirds since November 2021. <small>vc</small>s, too, are telling their portfolio firms to tighten their belts and generate cash.

In an echo of <small>vc</small>’s earliest days, when investors often backed semiconductor-makers that vied to win huge public contracts, many today are eyeing up firms in areas that stand to gain from governments’ new fondness for industrial policy.

Private equity firms control more than $6 trillion in assets in the U.S. But what makes them different from any other type of investor putting their money into a business?</p>\n \n \n \n<p>Private equity investors — typified by firms like Bain Capital, Apollo Global Management, TPG, KKR and Blackstone — are different from venture capitalists, who provide a cash infusion to small startups and hope they blossom into the next Facebook. Nor are they stock traders making split-second decisions to buy or sell shares in public companies.

Critics also worry that private equity firms weigh down acquired companies with substantial debt from the money borrowed to finance the purchase.</p>\n \n \n \n<h3>What Is Private Equity?</h3>\n \n \n \n<p>Private equity funds <a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/investment-products/private-investment-funds/private-equity">are pooled investments</a> that are generally not open to small investors. Private equity firms invest the money they collect on behalf of the fund’s investors, usually by taking controlling stakes in companies. The private equity firm then works with company executives to make the businesses — called portfolio companies — more valuable so they can sell them later at a profit.</p>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n<p>This is different from, say, an individual investor buying a share of Amazon stock for $135. Purchasing that share gives you an infinitesimal stake in the company and entitles you to any dividend the company may pay out, but your ownership stake isn’t large enough to affect the company’s decision-making and operations. Private equity funds, by contrast, are not publicly traded securities, and the amount they invest usually involves trying to take a controlling stake in companies.</p>\n \n \n \n<p>Private equity funds are generally backed by investments from large institutional investors: pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and very wealthy individuals. Private equity firms manage these funds, using both investors’ contributions and borrowed money.</p>\n \n \n \n<p>Like any business, private equity firms want to make money, generating returns for their investors. Fund managers typically spend time conducting extensive research on both companies and industries — called due diligence — before making an investment.

After months of inaction dealmakers are getting back to work. Economic uncertainty is still driving a wedge between the expectations of buyers and sellers, but more big deals were announced in March than any month since May last year. In one such deal Silver Lake, a tech investor, announced it would buy Qualtrics, a software firm, for more than $12bn, with $1bn in debt commitments—not much leverage, but a buy-out nonetheless. The industry that emerges from this period will be a different beast from the all-consuming giant of the 2010s. Private equity will be dogged by its folly at the top of the cycle. Growth in assets is likely to be less rapid. And the new phase will favour owners willing to roll up their sleeves and improve operations at the companies they have bought.</p><p>Since funds invested during downturns tend to be among private equity’s most profitable, some investment managers, sensing expectations of a recession have created bargains, are now itching to deploy capital. They are scooping up companies with valuations that have been struck by rising interest rates. On April 17th <small>thg</small> announced it had received a non-binding bid from Apollo, a big private-equity firm. The beleaguered British e-commerce company had seen its share price fall by 90% since 2021.

The American software firm had traded at a multiple of more than 15 in 2021. Bain Capital, another big private-equity firm, has built a $2.4bn tech-focused fund to take advantage of turbulence in the sector.</p><p>Corporate carve-outs also have gilet-wearing types excited. Such deals, where large companies shed unloved assets, have fallen as a share of private-equity transactions since the global financial crisis of 2007-09. But given tough economic conditions, companies are increasingly looking to sell “non-core” assets in order to focus operations and bolster balance-sheets. Spin-offs announced by American firms surged by around a third in 2022, according to Goldman Sachs, a bank. </p><p>The problem is that today’s bargains are yesterday’s rip-offs—and dealmaking was happening at a much faster pace a few years ago. Buying at the top of the market is a disaster whether that market is public or private. One steely private-equity boss says he likes to remind his investors that a buyer of Microsoft shares in the months before the dotcom bubble burst in 2000 would have had to wait until 2015 to break even. Until an investment is sold, the score is kept by quarterly valuations. Investors in private-equity funds are not expecting to see large write-downs in their investments.

(466, 'The Options Landscape for Hedge Funds', 'https://thehedgefundjournal.com/the-options-landscape-for-hedge-funds/', '<div><div><p>Hedge funds remain one of the most active users of both exchange-traded and OTC options, particularly in the US, but some managers may still be missing the opportunity that these instruments can offer them. Equity-based investment strategies dominate hedge funds, which account for a large slice of the equity options market. Many funds focus on the liquid US equity markets and use single stock options, ETF and index options to hedge risk. This article takes a brief tour of some of the ways in which options are being employed in hedge fund portfolios, as well as looking at some of the broader themes affecting their use. Future articles will look in more detail at some of the most widely used options strategies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>TYPES OF OPTIONS-BASED STRATEGY</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Defensive</strong><br />Covered put or call options have long been a fixture for the long/short equity manager, particularly in markets where there is a wide availability of single name contracts. In Asia, where the choice of single name options remains very limited, managers are still reliant on OTC contracts or simple volatility strategies. The equity hedgefund can use index-based puts and calls to cheaply hedge upside or downside exposure. Managers have been able to simultaneously profit from both long and short positions using options. However, it is difficult to achieve consistent returns on the short side during an upward-trending market as call selling is not a ‘set and forget’ strategy.</p>\n<p>There are more sophisticated defensive strategies that make regular use of options, like hedging tail risk. Hedge fund managers are highly cautious, as a result of bad experiences in 2007-08. They need to reassure investors that the fund is braced for the next black – or grey – swan event.</p>\n<p>It has also been observed that the value of put options – and not just equity puts – exploded during episodes of high volatility (e.g. the credit crisis and the flash crash), leading more fund managers to explore options as an alternative to defensive cash and Treasury bond holdings.</p>\n<p><strong>Covered call selling and yield enhancement</strong><br />The sale of covered calls by hedge funds is favoured during periods when fund managers are relatively neutral on the market. This generates premium income, and mitigates the potential downside exposure of a long underlying position. It is vital that the fund’s risk management team has a solid quantitative methodology allowing them to assess the probability of short calls being assigned, and the impact that this assignment might have on the fund’s senior strategy.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest risks with a yield-based strategy is that the holder of the option decides to exercise it to capture the dividend. While the maximum profit and break even are fairly clear from a risk management perspective, the likelihood of the option being exercised is also highly quantifiable, with a delta of .95 or above being a good benchmark. There also exists an early assignment risk for American-style options as the long holder of call options may exercise at any time prior to expiration, but most likely when the dividend is greater than the excess premium over intrinsic value.</p>\n<p><strong>Volatility</strong><br />Volatility-based strategies arguably make the most use of options, with implied volatility regarded as one of the most important components of options valuation. Many hedge funds use options to speculate on the direction of implied volatility, for example using CBOE® VIX® options or futures. Because implied volatility itself trades within a range that can be well defined via technical analysis, a fund can focus on the potential buying and selling points indicated via established price bands.</p>\n<p>Using straddles (put and call options bought (or sold) at the same strike price with the same expiry) and strangles (out of the money put and call options), managers can also take advantage of the volatility strike map curve – i.e. trading the skew as opposed to the at-the-money implied volatility. Volatility trading is also popular with algorithmic hedge funds, which can focus on trading it in favourable ranges while retaining a hedging capability.</p>\n<p><strong>Collar (split strike conversion)</strong><br />The collar’s appeal is its scope to reduce portfolio volatility, protect against losses and provide consistent returns, the Holy Grail for many hedge fund investors (see Fig.2).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In effect, if the hedge fund can buy sufficient shares to replicate an index (a 100% replication is not required),', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Mutual funds are riskier but they make more returns which is what makes them so attractive to the experienced investor. Hedge funds are only as good as the manager who is handling the investment and as a result a manager with a successful record charges more fees.</p>\n<p>There is no specific strategy that works for making huge returns in hedge funds and most fund managers who have a successful track record usually have a few of them up their sleeves. Let\x92s take a look at ten strategies that are commonly used in order to make huge returns:</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.hedgethink.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-09-at-07.24.04.png"></a></p>\n<p><strong>1. Leverage</strong></p>\n<p>This is one of the riskiest strategies that can go wrong if the hedge fund doesn\x92t<b> </b>make the expected returns. Using leverage or borrowing money for an investment in order to increase the returns is exactly what many strategies are made of. Investors borrow huge amounts of money for an investment that they are sure will make them huge returns and they would easily be able to return the money. However, all that goes horribly wrong when the market crashes. When used wisely, leveraging can help increase the returns. It is all about how much of leverage is being used.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Long Only\xa0</strong></p>\n<p>As the name suggests, the strategy here is about owning only long positions for a hedge fund whether in stocks or any other asset. The idea is to always set a long position so that when the hedge fund outperforms the benchmark, profit or alpha is generated.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Short Only\xa0</strong></p>\n<p>This is also a risky strategy and a difficult one as well. Using this strategy, a hedge fund only deals with short stocks. The idea is to short sell a stock that the manager is certain will go down. When the price does go down, you end up making a profit. However, if the market rises you will end up having to pay more than you invested and might lose it all.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Long/Short</strong></p>\n<p>This is a hybrid of short only and long only strategy and it works when a\xa0company holds a long position while selling stocks short as well.\xa0 By holding a long position for those stocks that the manager is certain will go up, they are anticipating returns whereas by short selling stocks that they predict will go down, they will make a profit with these stocks as well. If both strategies work out, the hedge fund will make huge returns.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Market Neutral</strong></p>\n<p>This is a unique strategy where equal parts of the portfolio are invested in long positions and short positions. So, this brings the net exposure of a portfolio to 0 whereas the gross would be 100%. This allows a hedge fund to make substantial returns regardless of whether the market goes up or down.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Relative Value Arbitrage</strong></p>\n<p>How this strategy works is that the manager purchases two bonds with the same date of maturity as well as credit quality. However, the coupon price is different for both. The bond with the higher priced coupon will sell at a premium whereas the lower priced coupon will stay at par or below it. The manager then sells the bond with the premium and buys the below par bond. Both will eventually mature at par which allows for the coverage and the short sell of the premium bond.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Equity Arbitrage</strong></p>\n<p>This strategy usually works for the hedge funds that are looking for stocks from firms that are undergoing a takeover. They will short sell the stocks of the firm being taken over and hold a long position for the stocks of the company that is taking over. This is done with the assumption that the company being taken over will trade down and the company that is taking over will trade up.</p>\n<p><strong>8.

His idea was to combine a “long” position (i.e., one that profits if the securities go up in price), typically a set of growth stocks, with a “short” position (i.e., one that profits if the securities go down in price) on the other part of the portfolio. Jones argued that this “long-short” strategy is more stable that either of the two parts by themselves — if the overall market goes up, the long positions are likely to dominate, producing gains, whereas if the overall market goes down, the short positions are likely to soften the blow, perhaps even yielding overall gains in spite of the down market.</p>\n<p>Jones’ original hedge fund <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Winslow_Jones">performed</a> very well. By 1966, Jones’ fund, over the previous five years, had outperformed the best mutual fund by 44%, and over the previous ten years had outperformed the best mutual fund by 87%. In the wake of Jones’ success, hundreds of new hedge funds were marketed, mostly following a similar long-short design.</p>\n<p>Today the term “hedge fund” is used as an umbrella to include a wide range of investment funds, typically not open to the general public, that employ some special investment technique. Thousands of hedge funds are now in operation, with approximately $4 trillion in assets in the U.S. alone.</p>\n<p>Long-short hedge funds <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-11/hedge-funds-stock-picks-fail-to-shield-investors-from-bear-market?srnd=premium">continue</a> to dominate the field. According to <a href="https://www.preqin.com/insights/global-reports/2022-preqin-global-hedge-fund-report">Preqin</a>, over 30% of U.S. hedge funds, with roughly $683 billion in assets, specialize in a long-short strategy. Clients of these funds are willing to pay the steep fees (typically 2% of assets per year, plus 20% of any profits) charged by these funds for the skill required to effectively manage such a portfolio.</p>\n<h4>Long-short hedge funds take a hit in 2022</h4>\n<p>Two October 2022 Bloomberg News reports (see <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-10/tiger-global-whale-rock-losses-mount-as-stock-pickers-reel">A</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-11/hedge-funds-stock-picks-fail-to-shield-investors-from-bear-market?srnd=premium">B</a>) paint a somewhat discouraging picture of U.S. hedge funds, particularly those that employ a long-short or other discretionary stock-picking strategy. Only about 21% of these hedge funds have a positive return so far in 2022; approximately 27% have a 0% to 10% decline, and some 53% have a decline of over 10%. On average, U.S. equity hedge funds are down 15% through the end of September. This analysis also found that the long stocks in U.S. long-short hedge funds are, on average, down 31% year-to-date, while shorts are down only 20%. In other words, these funds are losing more on the disappointing performance of long positions than they are profiting from short positions.

But the greatest anomaly is that despite decades of poor performance and the failure to effectively hedge exposure to conventional security classes, assets under management among hedge funds have grown from about $300 billion 25 years ago to about <a href="https://www.barclayhedge.com/solutions/assets-under-management/hedge-fund-assets-under-management/">$5 trillion</a> today.</p>\n<p>The following table provides the returns of the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index over the one-, 10- and 20-year periods ending December 2022:</p>\n<p><a href="/images/content_image/data/dc/dc916ba53cc9b365f27d74278c745c52.png"></a></p>\n<p>Over each of the one-, 10- and 20-year periods, hedge funds destroyed wealth because their returns were below the rates of inflation. Over the last 20 years, hedge funds barely managed to outperform virtually riskless one-year Treasury bills, and they underperformed traditional 60% stock/40% bond portfolios by wide margins. Surely, anyone who foresaw those results would have predicted that assets would flee the industry.</p>\n<p>Yet, in a triumph of hype, hope and marketing over wisdom and experience, assets grew dramatically.</p>\n<p>Another problem for investors is that the evidence demonstrates that hedge funds, in general, don’t hedge anything.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Hedge funds don’t hedge</strong></p>\n<p>In 2022, hedge funds managed to outperform equities and longer-term Treasury bonds. But by earning negative nominal returns, they once again demonstrated that the term “hedge fund” is an oxymoron – most hedge funds don’t hedge anything. While they may offer some diversification benefits, they are not hedges, which by definition increase in value when the assets they are supposed to be hedging lose value.</p>\n<p>The anomaly that is the growth of the industry is even stranger given that the performance of hedge funds has dramatically worsened over the past 25 years. For example, William Bernstein, author of the mini book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skating-Where-Puck-Was-Correlation-ebook/dp/B00AKJ7WZM"><em>Skating Where the Puck Was: The Correlation Game in a Flat World</em></a>, examined the returns of hedge funds, applying a three-factor analysis to the Hedge Fund Research Global Returns series for the period 1998 through 2012. Bernstein found that while hedge funds did produce large alpha in the first third of the period, as investor assets chased those returns, alpha shrank and then turned negative. From 1998 through 2002, hedge funds produced an incredible alpha of 9.0%. However, from 2003 through 2007, their alpha was -0.7%. And from 2008 through 2012, the alpha was -4.5%.

One of the paper’s most important results was that it provided the basic framework of 60% equities/40% bonds that became the anchoring benchmark for portfolio construction ever since. But now may be the time for investors to consider how best to apply and build on Markowitz’s insights in an increasingly dynamic environment – and multi-strategy hedge funds could have a role to play in further diversifying and enhancing absolute return potential in institutional portfolios.</p>\n<h2>New concerns about the old 60/40</h2>\n<p>MPT and the resulting 60/40 portfolio are driven by two key assumptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Correlation:<b> </b>Equities and fixed income have a low correlation.</li>\n<li>Returns:<b> </b>Portfolio components have an expected return above investors’ cost of capital <br /> (generally +/- 5% net real return, annualized).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, both of these assumptions now have problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Correlations between equities and fixed income have become highly variable,<a href="#_ftn1"><sup>1</sup></a> especially when viewed over longer periods, so using them as a foundational element of strategic asset allocation poses challenges.</li>\n<li>Expected returns for 60/40 portfolios are trending downward in parallel with US interest rates and are now below most institutions’ return requirements for several years.<a href="#_ftn2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Secular changes in monetary policy and the current trend in global interest rates appear to have destabilized the historical correlations between asset classes that formed one of the foundations for MPT and the 60/40 asset allocation framework.

Essentially this strategy means investing in assets beginning an up-trend while switching out of down-trend investments.</p>\n<p>Using fundamental, economic and technical data, managers utilizing tactical market timing can profit in all market conditions. The key to profiting here is to have a firm grasp of the effects of market movement on each of the different classes of assets.</p>\n<p>Managers using this tactic can use all available assets from stocks, mutual funds, derivative, indices, fixed income securities, and more. However, the volatility of this strategy is fairly high due to the inherent unpredictability of market movements and the difficulty of timing entry and exit from markets too.</p>\n<p><strong>Managed Futures</strong></p>\n<p>Using this two-tiered strategy, fund managers invest in financial and commodities futures markets. Directional bets are made with long and/or short positions. The first tier of this strategy means combining short-term pattern recognition with a longer-term trend-following outlook. The second tier tracks and trades in over 60 markets around the globe, using a fully automated trend-following approach.</p>\n<p>Managers specialising in managed futures are called Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs).</p>\n<p><strong>Quantitative</strong></p>\n<p>This strategy involves the use of computer programmers, employed to scour through data and statistical models in order to seek out alpha that hide behind market abnormalities. Super high-frequency trading programs are required, and these programs are capable of buying and selling thousands of stocks or futures in an instant.</p>\n<p>However, it’s not as straightforward as all that. These quant computer programs cannot always anticipate market commentary, and funds employing this strategy have made losses over the years as a result.</p>\n<p><strong>Aggressive Growth</strong></p>\n<p>This is quite a high risk strategy that involves investing in equities that are expected to experience acceleration in growth of earnings per share. Often this means investing in smaller and micro cap stocks that are set for rapid growth, with generally high P/E ratios, and low or no dividends.</p>\n<p>Funds using this strategy hedge by shorting stock indexes or by shorting equities where growth is expected to fall. This tends to be a ‘long-biased’ strategy, and includes sector specialist funds, including technology, biotech, and banking.</p>\n<p><strong>Leveraging</strong></p>\n<p>Not strictly a strategy, but this is a tactic that many funds use to increase potential profits. Leveraging basically means borrowing money, and it has resulted in spectacular returns – as well as spectacular failures.</p>\n<p>When applied in a measured, reasonable way strong investment or trading returns are increased by the extra money that is put to work. When overdone, too much leveraging can force a sell-off as the fund receives margin calls and is left with no choice but to sell positions to meet them.</p>\n<div><p></p><div><p>I am a writer based in London, specialising in finance, trading, investment, and forex.

With the rapid transformation of the financial industry, FinTech companies are at the forefront of this change, using technology to disrupt traditional banking and offer innovative solutions to meet our financial needs. These groundbreaking developments are making financial transactions faster, cheaper and more accessible than ever before.</p>\n<p>From mobile payments to digital currencies, the FinTech industry is revolutionizing the way we handle our money. With so much happening in the world of FinTech, it can be hard to keep up with the latest innovations. But fear not! In this article, we’ve compiled a list of seven exciting FinTech innovations that are changing the way we bank. Get ready to embark on a journey into the cutting-edge world of FinTech and discover how these new technologies could transform the way you manage your finances.</p>\n<h2><strong>Contactless payments</strong></h2>\n<p>The world of banking is being revolutionized by FinTech innovations, with contactless payments being one of the most thrilling developments. With <a href="https://www.opusconsulting.com/growth-trends-in-contactless-payments-technology/">contactless payment technology</a>, you can make transactions quickly and easily by simply tapping your card or scanning a QR code through your smartphone at the point of sale terminal. Contactless payments are not only convenient, but they are also secure, as they use encryption technology to protect your payment information.\xa0</p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has fueled the growth of contactless payments, as it reduces the need for physical contact and handling of cash. The global market for contactless payment transactions is projected to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5713439/contactless-payment-transaction-market-size">43.7% from 2022 to 2030</a>, starting from US$39.84 billion in 2021. The increasing adoption of contactless payment technology by merchants and consumers is a major factor driving this growth.\xa0</p>\n<p>Retail giants like Walmart and Target have implemented contactless payment options, making it easier for customers to pay for their purchases. Additionally, mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay have taken contactless payments to the next level by allowing users to make transactions with their phones.\xa0</p>\n<h2><strong>Digital currencies</strong></h2>\n<p>In the world of finance, digital currencies are making their mark, offering faster transaction times and lower transaction fees than traditional currencies.

Each year brings us new innovations designed to meet growing customer expectations. That’s why it’s important for business owners and executives to understand where we are now and where we’re headed with financial technology in order to maintain relevancy and competitiveness. Let’s talk about the top fintech trends that drive the market.</p><h2>Global Fintech Market Trends</h2>\n<p>Before diving into specific fintech areas, let’s take a look at the general fintech market trends that are game-changing for the financial technology scene and check some market statistics.</p>\n<div><div><p></p></div><p>Fintech market state</p></div>\n<h3>WEB 3.0 AND BLOCKCHAIN PROVIDE SECURITY AND DECENTRALIZATION</h3>\n<p>Following lofty promises and ambitious visions of the future of the Internet, Web 3.0 technologies and blockchain exploded worldwide. Сonsumers are increasingly favoring the ownership of digital goods, made possible by non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is exactly the technology that can support the economy of this virtual space by maintaining exceptional security and providing the necessary financial infrastructure. While cryptocurrencies are a means of payment there, NFTs are reliable proof of ownership of a particular digital asset.</p>\n<p>Based on the implementation of blockchain, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and the Internet of Things, Web 3.0 offers a high level of decentralization and personalization, providing financial services users with a completely new customer experience. For example, blockchain allows peer-to-peer transactions without financial intermediaries like banks. However, this does not take banks out of a growing trend. The American banking company J.P. Morgan, announced last year the use of blockchain technology in its new\xa0<a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/news/jpmorgan-uses-blockchain-technology-to-help-improve-money-transfers?ref=hackernoon.com">Confirm solution</a>, designed to reduce the cost of payments between banking institutions around the world.</p><p>So, blockchain is still an integral part of the development of the fintech market. According to\xa0<a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/fintech-blockchain-market-38566589.html?ref=hackernoon.com">Markets and Markets</a>, the fintech blockchain market size is expected to grow from $230.0 million in 2017 to $6,228.2 million by 2023.</p><h3>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MAKES FINANCIAL OPERATIONS SMARTER</h3>\n<p>Fintech solutions involve a great deal of data, and there’s no better technology to handle all that data than artificial intelligence. Specifically, machine learning. AI helps with a number of areas of fintech, like risk management, fraud prevention, decreasing operating costs through optimization, personalizing the banking experience, and automating workflows for team members and customers.</p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence is best used for recognizing patterns in data, and then AI-powered solutions can give suggestions based on findings to help users reduce or optimize their spending. AI allows financial companies to track the financial health of customers by collecting and processing information about their cash accounts, credit accounts and investments to provide customers with relevant and more personalized services. This can be done through tailored budgeting plans and spending analysis.</p><p>The Royal Bank of Canada uses the power of AI to improve user experience and deliver new applications to customers faster. RBC’s private AI cloud can analyze millions of data points, accelerating financial forecast analysis and enabling a company to build and deploy AI-powered apps more efficiently. And this is not the only example. According to Mordor Intelligence, AI in the fintech market is expected to grow from $7.91 billion in 2020 to $26.67 billion by 2026.</p><h3>EMBEDDED FINANCE EXPANDS SERVICES RANGE</h3>\n<p>Another top fintech trend is embedded finance, which allows financial technologies to be integrated into non-financial products.

That means it is a “business that meets the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose,” according to the Certified B Corporation website.</p>\n<p>Reiling’s career has centered on using banking as a force for good — not unusual for community bankers, but what sets Reiling apart is that he is also an entrepreneur. When he sees consumer needs that traditional banking approaches don’t meet — as he found in working with the Hmong community — he seeks practical alternatives, often in partnership with other organizations or community groups.</p>\n<p>“Traditional brick and mortar banks are not the preferred place for everyone, and cookie cutter banking products are not ideal,” Reiling insists. “Innovation is needed to make basic financial services more inclusive and accessible.”</p>\n<p>Advances in digital technology and the rise of the fintech movement opened up huge possibilities to assist individuals and businesses in ways that truly meet their needs. Reiling and his team were early in seeing the potential of partnering with fintechs, including a $125 million investment in TrueConnect, a tech-powered alternative to payday lending.</p>\n<p>Based on his experiences, Reiling wrote <em>Fintech4GOOD</em>, as he says, “to inspire others and showcase how financial technology companies are addressing the financial issues we face today.”</p>\n<p>The 125-page book is a quick read. It focuses on five entrepreneurs and the companies they launched to help remedy issues of economic inequality and other difficult financial issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/76589/innovation-talent-future-of-work-banking/%20?internal-link">Why Would Innovators Want to Work With a Bank?</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5 Fintechs Making a Difference</h2>\n<p>The five fintech companies profiled by Reiling in <em>Fintech4GOOD </em>include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Peanut Butter — Assists employers to offer student loan repayment assistance and provides financial tools to the graduates</li>\n<li>Nova — Provides a means for immigrants to use their home-country credit history in the U.S.</li>\n<li>Self Lender — Addresses young consumers’ lack of credit history and lack of savings in one solution</li>\n<li>Earnup — Helps people automate and manage credit card, student loan, and other debt payments using technology and psychology</li>\n<li>TrueConnect — Works with employers to offer workers a cheaper alternative to destructive payday loans when a financial emergency arises</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Besides its investment in TrueConnect, Sunrise Banks partners with that company and Self lender, providing both deposit and credit support as the “bank behind the fintech.”</p>\n<p>Reiling says that he profiled these five companies because they’re using technology to improve the lives of other people, especially those overlooked in some way by the traditional financial system. “But I also chose to feature these companies because most of them created their products based on the personal experiences of the founder, which makes the stories more compelling,” says Reiling. He acknowledges there are many other new companies with the same mindset of using fintech for good.</p>\n<p>The book frames the five companies and their solutions in the context of the problems they address. Highlighting these problems was in fact another primary reason for writing the book, Reiling says.:</p>\n<h4>“There are now more payday loan shops in the United States than there are McDonald', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

By their nature, many Fintech companies deal with highly sensitive consumer personal and financial information and face a host of privacy concerns and legal obligations that flow therefrom. In the United States, instead of a single federal regulatory framework governing all personal information, there are several different laws and regulations which impose various privacy and data security requirements on different sectors or jurisdictions. This article discusses the scope and requirements of two such laws of prominence for many Fintechs: the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the “GLBA”) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”).</p>\n<h2>GLBA</h2>\n<p><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-106publ102/pdf/PLAW-106publ102.pdf">The GLBA</a> regulates all collection, usage and disclosures of personal financial information, and broadly applies to all “financial institutions,” which are businesses that are “significantly engaged” in “financial activities,” as well as businesses whose services facilitate financial operations on behalf of financial institutions. What constitutes “financial activity” has been construed broadly, potentially encompassing many services provided by Fintechs. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the main agency that enforces the GLBA, while state law can require higher levels of compliance than what is required by the GLBA. The FTC has implemented regulations to carry out the GLBA’s financial privacy provisions (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2000/05/24/00-12755/privacy-of-consumer-financial-information">the “Privacy Rule”</a>) and information security provisions (the “<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/ftc-safeguards-rule-what-your-business-needs-know">Safeguards Rule</a>”).</p>\n<p>Under the Privacy Rule, financial institutions have several obligations towards consumers (defined as individuals “who obtain or ha[ve] obtained a financial product or service from the financial institution that is to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, or that person’s legal representative”) and customers (defined as “a subclass of consumers who have a continuing relationship with the financial institution”) whose nonpublic personal information (“NPI”) is handled by the financial institution. The Privacy Rule’s obligations do not extend to information collected about individuals who obtain financial products or services for commercial or business purposes. The Privacy Rule also does not apply to information collected from non-consumers, who have not obtained and are not obtaining financial products or services from the institution.</p>\n<p>A company that is subject to the Privacy Rule must provide a “clear and conspicuous” written notice describing the company’s privacy policies and practices, including the categories of information collected, the categories of information disclosed, the categories of affiliated and nonaffiliated parties to whom NPI will be disclosed, and policies and practices with respect to protecting NPI in accordance with the GLBA’s Safeguard Rule (described in detail below). Further, if the company shares NPI with third parties outside of the exceptions listed in the Privacy Rule, it must provide an opt-out notice explaining the consumer’s right to direct the institution not to share their NPI and a reasonable method for opting out. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to provide each consumer with a privacy notice both at the time they become a customer and every year that they remain one.</p>\n<p>The Safeguard Rule mandates financial institutions to develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive information security program that describes the specific measures taken to protect customer information. In late 2021, the FTC announced significant <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/09/2021-25736/standards-for-safeguarding-customer-information">new security requirements</a> for non-bank financial institutions subject to the GLBA which have been incorporated into the Safeguard Rule.

Data from the Congressional Budget Office show that Uncle Sam is running deficits of around 6% of gross domestic product, and is expected to keep doing so for years to come. It thinks inflation won’t get down toward the Fed’s target 2% rate until 2025.</p> <p>According to a comparison of the interest rates on regular 10 year Treasury bonds and inflation-protected 10 year Treasury bonds, the bond market is now betting that inflation will average 2.4% for the next decade. Anyone who thinks, or even fears, that it might be higher will be better off owning TIPS, inflation-protected bonds, compared with regular Treasurys.</p> <p>On the positive front, fund managers are now bearish, or out of love, with two stock market sectors that have traditionally appealed to retired investors because they have usually produced high and steady dividends: real-estate investment trusts, and utilities.</p> <p>On REITs, money manager sentiment is now so bearish BofA Securities calls it “capitulation.” Their sentiment is back to levels last seen in 2008-9 levels, during the biggest real estate collapse since the Great Depression.

(514, 'The Worst Bond Market Ever', 'https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1126416/the-worst-bond-market-ever', '<div><div><h2><strong>Portfolio Matters</strong></h2> <p>In the grand scheme of things, balanced portfolios have not performed terribly in recent months. The chart below shows the worst 12-month returns since 1926, adjusting for the effects of inflation, for a U.S.-based portfolio consisting of 50% stocks, 40% intermediate-term government notes, and 10% cash. (For simplicity’s sake, I have included only the steepest loss posted during each bear market.)</p> <p> </p> <p>Although the returns have by no means been pleasant, performance overall rates merely as bad, not historically awful. Not only was the Great Depression’s largest loss nearly twice the size of today’s decline, but three other periods also posted significantly greater decreases: 1) the 2009 global financial crisis, 2) the 1973-74 oil crisis, and 3) the post-World War II funk. Also somewhat worse than this year was the headache following the <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/18946/the-go-go-years-by-john-brooks-and-michael-lewis/9781101914144">“go-go” years</a> of the 1960s.</p> <p>(Worth noting is the absence of a chronological pattern. In order of magnitude, the six selloffs occurred during the 1930s, the 2000s, the 1970s, the 1940s, the 1960s, and the 2020s. We can perhaps consider the Great Depression an anomaly that will not be repeated. Since then, though, there’s no hint that bear markets have become either less frequent or less severe with time.)</p> <h2><strong>Saved by Stocks</strong></h2> <p>The relative blessing for this year’s market has been equities. For the most part, balanced portfolios head where their stocks lead them. (This insight informs the strategy for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_parity">risk-parity funds</a>, which have sorely disappointed their investors in 2022. But that is a tale for another column.) In recent months, growth stocks have struggled mightily, but value stocks have remained steadfast. As shown below, their support has made 2022 look fairly good from an equity-only perspective. (The exercise is conducted as before, by seeking the lowest real 12-month returns, but this time it is calculated solely from the performance of U.S. stocks.)</p> <p> </p> <p>At negative 21.6%, the recent stock market drop fails to make the bottom six.</p> <h2><strong>Bad News Bonds</strong></h2> <p>The same, regrettably, cannot be said for bonds. Among fixed-income securities, there has been no refuge. Interest rates have spiked across the yield curve, thereby sinking all investment-grade debt. Lower-quality notes have also struggled. Sometimes when interest rates rise, junk bonds perform well, because credit spreads tighten. Not this year. Instead, credit spreads have widened owing to fears of a recession. The result has been comprehensive bond market losses.</p> <p>The next exhibit demonstrates the point. It is calculated in the same fashion, and over the same period, as the previous two charts. That is, it presents the worst trailing 12-month results since 1926, including the effects of inflation. In this instance, though, the illustration depicts intermediate-term U.S. government notes, rather than either balanced portfolios or the domestic stock market.</p> <p> </p> <p>Two items from this chart stand out.</p> <p>First, the bars are much shorter here. True, the bond market’s fringes can be volatile. For example, long Treasury bonds dropped 34% in real terms from November 2021 through October 2022. That almost matches the lowest real return from a balanced fund during the Great Depression! But mainstream fixed-income securities, of the type held within an intermediate-term government index or the major taxable-bond funds, are usually quite stable.</p> <p>Second, the current bond market rates as the past century’s worst. Barring substantial further losses, the stock market’s decline will soon be forgotten, buried in a database for future internet columnists to disinter. But the bond market’s downturn will long be remembered. The after-inflation loss for intermediate-term government bonds has been even greater than during the second oil crisis that ran from 1979 through 1981', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Despite the brief calamity, investors emerged largely unharmed, because the technical glitch was with the NYSE’s trading platform.

This would shake investor confidence in this country’s public market, and might even affect the attractiveness of U.S. capital markets to private U.S. companies and foreign issuers.

That variability is leading timberland and forest products giant Weyerhaeuser to rethink its dividend strategy. The company, which paused its dividend for much of 2020 due to the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, unveiled a new base plus variable supplemental dividend framework in October.</p><p>Under the new plan, Weyerhaeuser will pay out a base dividend of $0.17 per share each quarter, half of its previous fixed rate. That works out to a roughly 2% yield at the current price, above the S&amp;P 500\'s 1.6% average. The company set that lower base dividend because it\'s more sustainable during market rough patches since the roughly $500 million annual outlay matches its historical free cash flow during market downturns. In addition to that base payment, Weyerhaeuser also plans to pay a variable dividend with it targeting to return 75% to 80% of its annual excess free cash flow to shareholders. Thus, if it has a good year, it will pay out much more in dividends than the current base. The company expects to pay its first variable dividend in the first quarter of 2022, based on 2021\'s cash flow, which is why income investors should keep an eye on Weyerhaeuser since a strong year could set them up for a lot more future income. </p><h2>A potential dividend gusher</h2><p>The oil patch has been a tough place for dividend investors over the years due to oil price volatility.

High-dividend stocks can be a good choice.</p><p></p><h2>What are dividend stocks?</h2><p></p><p>Dividend stocks distribute a portion of the company\'s earnings to investors on a regular basis.</p><p>Most American dividend stocks pay investors a set amount each quarter, and the top ones increase their payouts over time, so investors can build an annuity-like cash stream. (Investors can also choose to reinvest dividends if they don\'t need the stream of income. Here\'s more about <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/what-are-dividends/">dividends and how they work</a>.)</p><p>Companies that pay dividends tend to be well-established, so dividend stocks may also add some stability to your portfolio. That\'s one reason they\'re included on our list of <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/safe-investments-low-risk-options">low-risk investments</a>.</p><p></p><h2>Investing for income: Dividend stocks vs. dividend funds</h2><p></p><p>There are two main ways to invest in dividend stocks: Through mutual funds — such as index-funds or <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/what-is-an-etf/">exchange-traded funds</a> — that hold dividend stocks, or by purchasing individual dividend stocks.</p><p>Dividend ETFs or index funds offer investors access to a selection of dividend stocks within a single investment — that means with just one transaction, you can own a portfolio of dividend stocks. The fund will then pay out dividends to you on a regular basis, which you can take as income or reinvest. Dividend funds offer the benefit of instant diversification — if one stock held by the fund cuts or suspends its dividend, you can still rely on income from the others.</p><p>Whether it’s through dividend stocks or dividend funds, reinvesting those dividends can greatly enhance your return on investment; dividends typically increase the return of a stock or dividend fund by a few percentage points. For example, historically the total annual return (which includes dividends) of the S&amp;P 500 has been, on average, about two percentage points higher than the index\'s annual change in value.</p><p>And that difference can really add up. Using NerdWallet’s <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/investment-calculator/">investment calculator</a>, we can see that a $5,000 investment that grows at 6% annually for 20 years could grow to over $16,000. Bump that up to 8% growth to include dividends, and that $5,000 could grow to over $24,000.</p><p>In general, a good rule of thumb is to invest the bulk of your portfolio in index funds, for the above reasons. But investing in individual dividend stocks directly has benefits.</p><p>Although it requires more work on the part of the investor — in the form of research into each stock to ensure it fits into your overall portfolio — investors who choose individual dividend stocks are able to build a custom portfolio that may offer a higher yield than a dividend fund. Expenses can also be lower with dividend stocks, as ETFs and index funds charge an annual fee, called an expense ratio, to investors.</p><p></p><h2>How to invest in dividend stocks</h2><p></p><p>Building a portfolio of individual dividend stocks takes time and effort, but for many investors it\'s worth it. Here’s how to buy a dividend stock:</p><p>1. Find a dividend-paying stock. You can screen for stocks that pay dividends on many financial sites, as well as on your online broker\'s website. We\'ve also included a list of high-dividend stocks below.</p><p>2. Evaluate the stock. To look under the hood of a high-dividend stock, start by comparing the dividend yields among its peers. If a company’s dividend yield is much higher than that of similar companies, it could be a red flag. At the very least, it’s worth additional research into the company and the safety of the dividend.</p><p>', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Even though the term "asset" has a wide definition, it often pertains to everything that can be regulated and utilized to either preserve or generate more wealth. These comprise both the tangible and intangible assets that any\xa0business owns. It could seem like a waste of time and resources to invest time and money in maintaining assets that don\'t bring in any earnings. But when a firm expands and flourishes, <a href="https://myassignmentexperts.com/asset-management">asset management</a> becomes increasingly crucial, and neglecting your company\'s assets can lead to a fiscal disaster. When controlled properly, assets can promote stability, growth, and prosperity for the business. However, poor management techniques can harm your business\'s performance and perhaps even stifle or eliminate prospects for growth.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is Asset Management?</strong></h2>\n<p>Asset management is to increase a financial portfolio\'s equity over time while keeping risk at a sustainable rate. Although asset management is not a novel or ground-breaking idea, it has significant implications for enterprises. When properly implemented, asset management addresses the most important issues affecting an organization and enables more effective growth.</p>\n<p>Asset management is beneficial to businesses in a variety of ways. These advantages are not all directly related to monetary outcomes. With the aid of an appropriate asset management system, asset monitoring generates a continuous flow of data, promotes accountability, and maintains budgeting and asset maintenance on schedule. Asset tracking software available and run by experts often addresses some of the shortcomings of previous measurement techniques, such as relying on inaccurate data and having no way to know how different assets of the organization are operating.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is the role of the Asset Manager?</strong></h3>\n<p>A particular group of assets is managed by an asset manager. By monitoring assets, the asset manager hopes to reduce costs.

Consequently, each asset\'s life cycle is divided into four separate stages:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Planning – It is the first stage of the asset life cycle. At this phase, the asset requirements are developed and confirmed. An\xa0evaluation of existing assets and their capacity to meet customer expectations will help determine asset requirements</li>\n\t<li>Acquisition - The entire process of acquiring an asset and ensuring a cost-effective acquisition is covered by acquisition planning. This involves activities like asset creation and purchasing</li>\n\t<li>Operation - It covers the use and management of an asset, particularly preservation, to deliver active support. To prevent operational changes during this time, the company should concentrate on a single asset for proper inspection, tracking, and prospective improvement. Maintenance and operation encompass improvements, patch fixes, new license acquisitions, assessment processes, and cost-benefit analyses</li>\n\t<li>Disposal - An asset may be considered an overstock or an outperforming asset as it nears its end.

Simply put, asset management is geared towards bringing about greater value from the assets of the company, and using them to achieve more competitive performance and productivity.</p><p>\nAsset management tools should also be effective in the curtailment of asset ownership and the calculation of asset-related risks. It should also be able to provide for accurate inventory control and data storage. Most of all, it must engender wiser decision making where assets management is concerned, in the face of consistently shifting technology and cutthroat competition.</p><p>\nWhy asset management is essential for organizational growth</p><p>\nAsset management encompasses not merely the actual physical and intangible assets of any organization, but more importantly, the effective utilization of each. This essentially means that asset management caters to various disciplines- from administration to engineering, and from production to information management.</p><p>\nWith successful asset management, growth is imminent. Labor and production becomes efficient, downtimes on equipment and facilities are minimized, and the total cost of fixed asset ownership is significantly reduced. Solutions for better asset management are available from providers, all offering different solutions to the more specific asset-related concerns. Organizations must be able to pinpoint the areas that need to be enhanced, seek the assistance from management solution providers, and to work alongside these management tools.</p><p>\nAsset management growth is not a one-way street, nor is it expected to happen in a momentary tick. Asset management will continue to shift and evolve, and industry managers must be able to understand this from the beginning, to achieve the most favorable results for the entire organization.</p>\n<p>\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0<b><i>- Mohammed Zahran -</i></b></p>\n</div>', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Well we have the answers.</p>\n<h3>What is an asset?</h3>\n<p>Let’s begin with the term ‘asset’. An ‘Asset’ is a resource (like an item, stakes, etc.). Each of these has an economic value that is expected to be beneficial in the future. Essentially, ‘assets’ are those which can improve sales, reduce expenses or generate cash flow. All kinds of businesses, small or large, create or build assets to increase the operations and increate value. It is an important aspect of building a business. So companies invest a lot in managing their assets. Most companies invest in short-term (or current) assets, fixed assets, financial assets and intangible assets.</p>\n<h3>What is asset management?</h3>\n<p>Asset management refers to how funds are managed. It includes the development, operation, maintenance and selling of the assets in a way that brings profit for the organisation in the future. There are people and companies which work full time on managing assets on behalf of companies.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why Is Asset Management Important?</strong></h3>\n<p>Asset management helps a company keep a track of their stakes. Apart from the above benefits, asset management helps in building amortisation rates accuracy. As well as identifying and managing risks. It also helps to remove ghost assets in the inventory of a company. Further benefits include:</p>\n<h4>Tracking of assets</h4>\n<p>Asset management helps an organisation keep a check on their fixed and liquid assets. It gives a wider look at the success graph of that company. As well and help the investor to analyse it for future opportunities. The owner knows their assets, their locations and their usages. So this makes asset recovery effective and efficient.</p>\n<h4>Risk identification and management</h4>\n<p>A company needs to keep a check on its progress; the rise or fall of the asset count or amount gives a broad view of the status. The company can then identify the risk if it sees a fall in the assets. It makes risk management easier and accessible. It also\xa0helps build rates of amortisation accuracy. In the tech-oriented and fast-paced world, keeping yourself updated is the trick to shine. One of the functions of asset management is to keep the financial statements updated which achieves this purpose.</p>\n<p>Further to this in finance and accounts, book keeping includes loss, damage and stolen assets. Strategic asset management plans helps in keeping the company aware of the lost and damaged assets. So, preventing them from adding to the books and ledger.</p>\n<h4>Improving Compliance</h4>\n<p>Every company (be it non-profit organisation, government agencies and companies) have to submit a detailed report of the ways they have used to acquire, use and dispose of its assets. In this case, it is eased by the central database which holds all the required information. Asset management removes any backlogs and hurdles and makes it easy to represent the financial report.</p>\n<h4>Improving Acquisition and Use</h4>\n<p>Having a strategy always helps. It takes a business to the next level. It refines the business and discovers the issues and bad practices followed.</p>\n<h3><b>Developing a strategic asset management lan</b></h3>\n<p>Any enterprise, be it private or public, have to maintain assets and ownership. For the smooth functioning of the organisation, the companies have to develop a strategy to build strategies. A Sstrategic Asset Management Plan achieves the following:</p>\n<h4>Enlist all assets</h4>\n<p>In accounts language, we call it completing an asset inventory. The owner must keep an eye on the number of the assets in his inventory. To be successful, a proper sheet must be maintained. It is because the strategies will differ accordingly as per the number and the value of the assets available with one. Managing them effectively will become a problem. There are certain aspects which are to be prepared an inventory of the assets. These are where the assets are, total count of assets, the value of each asset, when the assets were acquired, the expected life cycles of the assets.</p>\n<h4>Figure out life-cycle costs</h4>\n<p>Computation of the life-cycle costs of each asset plays a key role in building', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

It can become quite tedious and almost impossible for a person to do it all by themselves. Some of the most important things that one would need to know all the time are the real-time location, the overall productivity, and other related information for all their assets.

As an exercise, just try to list them. You\'ve got laptops, desktops, monitors, printers, and phones. Maybe you\'ve got servers and a Wi-Fi router. Can you also list the makes and models of each — and do you know how old they are and when they\'re likely to need replacing?</p>\n<p>What about your software? Whether installed or in the cloud, you\'ve got software for productivity, constituent management, presentations and video conferencing, accounts for social media, and more. Do you know how many licenses you have, or what the registration keys are?</p>\n<p>The more technology becomes a part of our work, the more difficult it becomes to keep track of. However, by taking time to get organized, your organization can use its tech more effectively, save money, and better plan for the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Why Do Your Tech Assets Need Management?</h2>\n<p>When technology is functional, we tend\xa0not\xa0to think about it. But when it comes to work, an outage can quickly become a crisis. A crashed computer or busted router can derail staff and hinder efficiency.</p>\n<p>Managing your organization\'s tech assets helps you know when hardware is reaching its end-of-life stage so you can plan to replace it before it stops working. Similarly, keeping track of software helps you plan for updates — especially when a major update might mean a change in how you work. For example, if you\'re running an older version of WordPress, an update might affect the design of your pages or their functionality. So you have to plan for how to update your website in a way that works well in the latest version without unplanned downtime.</p>\n<p>Keeping track of your tech can help ensure that you have the right software licenses for staff. It can also prevent duplication — especially if individual staff members have the power to make tech decisions on their own. Does your organization need all of those computer monitors? Why are there three different Survey Monkey accounts? A process to avoid acquiring unneeded tools or to catch unnecessary expenses in your tech ecosystem can be a big benefit.</p>\n<p>Managing your tech can also help you plan for the future. Do you hope to expand an existing program? Or is it time to streamline your organization to focus on what you do best? By inventorying and managing your tech assets, you can figure out whether you already have the number of software licenses or user accounts that you need, or whether you need to invest in new tools. It makes budgeting easier and also helps you imagine the realities of what it will take to pull off that bold new idea.</p>\n<p>Let\'s take a look at what it takes to manage your technology assets effectively.</p>\n<p><a href="https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/2980581/fb859aaf-9411-412e-b430-faeede50a193"></a></p>\n<h2>Take an Inventory</h2>\n<p>Start by getting to know what hardware and software your organization currently owns. In general, your hardware inventory should list the type and model, how old it is, and who it\'s assigned to. For software, you want the vendor name and type of product and what version you\'re running, as well as when licenses or subscriptions need to be renewed and when vendor updates are scheduled. This information provides a baseline for understanding your technology environment.</p>\n<p>Using a spreadsheet to track your inventory lets you see entries over time, giving you a history of your organization\'s tech, as well as the ability to search and sort as needed. For smaller organizations without a lot of hardware or software to track, this is probably sufficient.</p>\n<p>But larger organizations with dozens of users and hundreds of tools might use an IT asset management system. With an IT asset management system you can monitor, control, and document all hardware and software. This central repository of IT asset data then allows you to evaluate potential risks and take action to reduce those risks. Many systems also enable you to automatically patch software and push updates to multiple devices at once. And you typically can track renewal and expiration dates, collect purchasing invoices, file contracts and warranties, and manage vendor information.</p>\n<p>Low-cost IT asset management systems include UpKeep, Fresh', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Along with the downturn comes pain, from layoffs in Silicon Valley to crypto message boards on Reddit with suicide hotlines affixed to Walmart indicating that broader job cuts are going to come soon. It’s an ugly situation.</p><p>And yet, while it’s painful and sad, this collapse, in many ways, can’t come soon enough. The drop in the markets is necessary.</p><p>To understand why, it helps to start with the purpose of finance. Financial markets are critical in any free society, because they enable flexibility in production and distribution. Without the ability to borrow money, speculate, and go bankrupt, it is very difficult if not impossible to systemize innovation, kill off old and inefficient firms, or cater to consumer tastes. Yet, finance should be a <em>small </em>part of the economy, because speculation isn’t intrinsically valuable. Banks should serve production, providing capital to ventures that will eventually generate income. </p><p>Sometimes, however, financiers are able to take control of production, and that leads to wild inefficiencies, speculation purely on asset price inflation, and eventually authoritarian politics. As economist John Maynard Keynes wryly put it, “When the capital development of a country becomes a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done.” That’s where we are now. Compensation for financial intermediaries has historically cost about 2% of GDP; today it’s<a href="https://www.russellsage.org/sites/all/files/Rethinking-Finance/Philippon_v3.pdf"> at 9%</a>.

I think about the credit card I got during my freshman year in college because it was supposedly "a good way to build my credit." I reminisce on the student loan debt I incurred during my years in college. I remember how nervous I was when I signed the mortgage note on my first home when I was barely old enough to rent a car. </p><p>My personal favorite was the major credit card I signed up for at a baseball game so I could get a Cincinnati Reds baseball cap. Three years later, I couldn\'t tell you where that cap went, but I can definitely tell you that I was in over my head in debt with that credit card. I actually paid it off multiple times, yet they kept increasing my limit. So I kept spending it. </p><p>Years later, having paid off all of this debt and having a totally different frame of mind as it relates to personal finance, I wonder what it would have taken to have prevented me from making all of those financial mistakes so early in my life. What happened between then and now that changed my way of thinking? It was education in the subject matter and the stress that the lack of personal financial knowledge brought on me and my household. I simply had no guidance on this matter coming out of high school.</p><p><strong>Troubling Statistics about Money Management</strong></p><p>According to Charles Schwab\'s 2011 Teens &amp; Money Survey, 77 percent of teens surveyed believe they are financially savvy about money, yet only 35 percent confess to knowing how to balance a checkbook or manage a credit card. A mere 31 percent understand how credit card interest and fees work. Incredibly, only 22 percent of these teens surveyed understand how income taxes work. </p><p>These are astonishing figures! Today\'s youth think they know about personal finance, yet they confess to not knowing things that form the base of the personal finance pyramid. The scariest figure in the survey is that 77 percent of those surveyed say that their parents have been great role models when it comes to money management and have taught them a lot. Our younger generation is learning their money habits from the most leveraged generation in United States history, and we as a nation are doing very little to stop this cycle. Our government can\'t even agree on a budget. Our answer is to simply borrow and lend more money. We must break the cycle.</p><p>I could have personally avoided my debt had someone or some institution been more active in presenting personal finance education to me. This education has to start in our schools. According the 2011 Survey of the States by the Council for Economic Education, only 13 states require their students to take a high school course in personal finance prior to graduation. Of those 13 states, only five require student testing in order to complete this requirement. That\'s a mere 10 percent of our states that are properly educating the younger generation on topics relating to personal finance. </p><p>I was never even offered a personal finance class. This is where the problem lies. We as a nation are simply not teaching this vital life skill to the younger generation. The solution to our financial problems is not lending more money or making interest rates cheaper. The solution is found at the core, and that is the education of the next generations regarding personal finance. We must teach students about the pitfalls of credit cards, how to balance a checkbook, how a loan works and what an amortization schedule looks like, or our situation will never change. We are sending these graduates out into the real world to fight a battle with nothing more than a paper sword. They are about to incur the most amount of debt in their lives in the few years following high school, and it is imperative they understand how to win this battle. </p><p><strong>How to Educate Students about Personal Finance</strong></p><p>So, how do we solve this problem? Here are four steps. </p><p>1.Personal finance education must begin at home. Parents must actively counsel their children as to how income, credit cards, loans and bills work. They must also impart the concept of saving and not just spending. </p><p>2.Local schools should offer personal finance classes to high school students, and require them to take it and pass it as we would with any other class. </p><p>3.Students can get online and educate themselves. There is some personal accountability here that students must realize. There are plenty of options out there to assist in this area. The FDIC', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

However, those people often don’t fill in the gaps because money can be such a loaded or taboo topic.</p>\n<p><a href="https://financiallysavvylatina.weebly.com/about.html">Natalie Torres-Haddad</a>, who grew up in southern California, saw many people around her struggling with debt and financial instability. She was determined to be the exception, and she purchased her first rental property in her early 20s and earned an MPA in Finance &amp; International Business. In the process, however, she became buried in debt. Only by teaching herself the basics of money — basics that she’d never learned — was she able to steady herself and her finances.</p>\n<p><strong>Today she leads workshops and sessions to prevent others from falling into the money pit.</strong> (She’s also the author of the self-published <a href="https://financiallysavvyin20minutes.com/"><i>Financially Savvy in 20 Minutes</i></a>). She’s found that even among the college-educated people she meets, “the majority feel confused and overwhelmed about balancing their income and expenses,” she says. The stats show they’re not alone. A 2015 Ohio State University study reported <a href="http://www.dailyhelmsman.com/news/student-loans-leading-cause-of-stress-in-college-students/article_5e1be474-2708-11e8-a771-87e1ac53e28f.html">nearly 70 percent of college graduates</a> in the US say they don’t feel equipped to manage money and deal with their debt.</p>\n<p><b>Not only must we get up to speed on the basics, we also need to start having honest conversations with each other about money,</b> <b>says Torres-Haddad.</b> In the same way we’d tell family and friends that we’re cutting out refined sugar from our diets or practicing yoga to increase our flexibility, we should be open with them about the steps we’re taking to boost our financial health. That way, we can get advice and support. This transparency, she adds, can also make us less susceptible to peer pressure-related spending. How many of us have agreed to a pricey meal or weekend trip because we didn’t want to come clean about our money concerns?</p>\n<p><b>Becoming financially literate does not require a huge time investment. </b>Torres-Haddad believes we can start<b> </b>by dedicating 15 – 20 minutes a day to developing our skills and knowledge by learning new terms and resources.

It\'s a statement as common as white bread with even more dire health effects. The fact is, most families do not sit down with their children and talk about money—how it\'s earned, spent, invested or used. But that doesn’t mean that money lessons aren’t learned anyway. Our kids absorb through listening and observation. They know relative to their peers whether they have more (or fewer) toys and clothes, go on more vacations or have a bigger (or smaller) home. They form opinions, even without any formal discussion.</p>\n<p>As the emerging professional said those words while talking about her money memories, I watched the look on her father\'s face. He tried to hide his embarrassment, thinking that somehow he had failed his daughter. His fears were somewhat allayed hearing her talk about her strong money values and focus on building a goals-oriented financial life.</p>\n<p>Money education is not necessarily the "sit at the kitchen table and let me tell you about money" formal lessons. It also comes in the form of watching, listening and gathering information. While the outcomes can be positive and strong, as it was in this case, it can be just as easily be destructive.</p>\n<p>When I was eight, my father asked me to hand him the rip saw. I reached into his tool box and handed him a saw. Turns out it wasn\'t the correct saw, but to me, all saws look alike. After being "firmly" instructed in the differences between a rip saw, a reciprocating saw, a circular saw, a compass saw and three more saws that meant absolutely zero to me, I realized my life would probably not revolve around the use of tools. And sure enough, it hasn’t.</p>\n<div>\n \n <p>(Photo credit: Wikipedia)</p> \n \n </div>\n<p>Learning requires a teacher and a student, both willing participants. In my case, learning about saws was an epic fail. In the case of this woman and her dad, life lessons around money and goals were well taught and well learned. Families that live strong values around money have better than even odds that their kids have picked up on their lessons.</p>\n<p>For those whose respect for money is less than golden, you might be passing on the same confused messages. Some prime examples? You grew up overly concerned with "what will the neighbors think?” or have a deep need to show wealth. Or maybe you never felt the need to save for the inevitable "rainy day", avoid unnecessary debt and have meaningful financial goals.</p>\n<p>One reason why many families don\'t talk about money is our own discomfort around the conversation. It isn\'t "polite" to talk about money. And parents may not have any real financial knowledge (which is about more than your investment portfolio). After all, how many parents are properly equipped to have a meaningful discussion on the importance of the definition and exclusions within a disability insurance policy, why you need a Durable Power of Attorney or how much should be in an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/best-places-to-keep-your-emergency-fund/">emergency fund</a>? We are more likely to talk about the weather in Thailand than to have a serious discussion of budgeting and tax deduction</p>\n<p>And yet, wanting a solid understanding of financial matters is something I hear all the time from clients who feel dissatisfied with their level of financial education.</p>\n<p>I recommend taking the time to read and learn so that we can end the cycle of inadequate financial comfort. There are great resources available like "Financial Fitness Forever" by Paul Merriman or "The Wall Street Journal Guide to Starting Your Financial Life" by Karen Blumenthal. For those who find themselves caught in the mire of a poor money mindset, read "Wired for Wealth" by Brad Klontz, Psy.D, et al.</p>\n<p>Financial literacy is important.\xa0 It doesn\'t mean you have to become a Certified Financial Planner, but you need to understand your financial life to improve it. Chances are you can hire someone who knows which saw to choose, but when it comes to your money, nothing beats a good education.</p>\n</div>', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

For instance, we might set a goal of reducing high school dropout rates by 10% in our community, or a goal of increasing the quality of the observations of one hundred amateur astronomy clubs. Nevertheless, we often aren’t sure what our financial goals are, or even what they should be. If the financial goal in a for-profit company is to maximize profit, should our goal as a nonprofit be to have $0 profit? Or should the goal be to grow an endowment of $10 million, or to have a surplus of 5%, or a deficit of no more than $50,000?</p>\n<p>In classical economics, the answer to this question is that the financial goal of a nonprofit is to ensure that it has adequate working capital; that is, its financial goal is to have enough money to do its work over the long term. Today we often use the term sustainability for this goal.</p>\n<p>But the term is used in different ways to suggest various things. Foundations and social entrepreneurs often describe a plan for sustainability as one that relies on earned income rather than on donations (although both earned income and donations can support long-term financial viability). When strategic plans are said to include goals for sustainability, what is often meant is that the plans include the goal of developing a more diversified income base. And environmentalists describe sustainability in terms of practices that are nonpolluting and that conserve energy and natural resources.</p>\n<p>We like the United Nations’ definition of sustainability: doing what is required “to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” And we like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability">Wikipedia definition</a> of sustainability: “the capacity to endure.”</p>\n<p>Here are two ways of thinking about sustainability in a nonprofit context:</p>\n<p>1. Sustainability encompasses both financial sustainability (the ability to generate resources to meet the needs of the present without compromising the future) and programmatic sustainability (the ability to develop, mature, and cycle out programs to be responsive to constituencies over time).</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Sustainability is an orientation, not a destination</strong>.

By neoliberalism, I mean liberalism that favors free-market capitalism that has led to mass-globalization and mass-consumption of resources. This operating economic system enables corporations to decimate life in the name of profit and privatization, for political favoritism. In the Soul of Capitalism, William Greider shares, “The consumer has become such a hallowed intuition, it is easy to forget that the feat of mass consumption is rather a recent phenomenon in human history.” Deployed on the wings of Neoliberal capitalism, Greider says, “The darkening shadow cast across the mass consumption economy has many threatening expressions. We are the 6th mass extinction.” We can not depend on Government or the business sector to solve this global crisis. I believe we must redesign financial and market systems from the inside out, to make them regenerative rather than life destroying. Regenerative means renewal or restoration. It’s a process of recycling energy within any system to generate life. As Paul Hawken says, “Preserving Life should be the natural result of commerce, not the exception.”</p><p><strong>What is Transition Economics?</strong></p><p>Transition economics is a growing counter-cultural trend over the last twenty years toward more localization of food, energy, goods, and services. Transitionists are moving away from a dependency on a global, unsustainable fossil fuel-based economy. The transition culture is responding appropriately to massive resource depletion, global energy crises, rising fuel and food prices, plummeting markets, and the threat of global climate change. Towns, organizations, and entire governments are finding that localization is a win-win for the economy, environment, community development, and quality of life. The Transition Town Movement founded in 2005 in Kinsale, Ireland, was replicated in Totnes England and has since spread throughout Europe and into the Americas. Transition Towns across the world are redesigning their local economies to transition away from centralized petroleum and other unsustainable systems. Permaculture has and will continue to help us design this path forward.</p><p><strong>What is Permaculture?</strong></p><p>At the core of Permaculture are three ethics: people care, earth care and fair share. The roots of Permaculture began as a means of applying patterns and principles found in nature to design human agriculture and land use systems within these ethical parameters. Practitioners harness principles from their observations of living systems and apply them to a holistic and regenerative approach of designing human systems that care for the needs of both people and the planet.</p><p>David Holmgren, co-originator of Permaculture in the mid-1970’s says, “Permaculture is consciously designed landscapes which mimic the patterns and relationships found in nature while yielding an abundance of food, fiber, and energy for provision of local needs. People, their buildings, and the ways that they organize themselves are central to Permaculture.” To add another voice in defining the broadest sense of Permaculture, designer Robyn Francis says, “Permaculture refers to land-use systems, including human settlements, which utilize resources in a sustainable way. From a philosophy of cooperation with nature and each other, of caring for the earth and people, it presents an approach to designing environments which have the diversity, stability, and resilience of natural ecosystems, to regenerate damaged land and preserve environments which are still intact.”</p><p>Over the last two decades, the field of Social Permaculture has emerged, utilizing that same sound thinking Permaculturalists apply to landscapes, to designing communities, businesses, organizations, and financial systems. Social Permaculture acknowledges and incorporates the intricacies of human relationships and invisible structures such as finance into the scope of Permaculture as a design science. In this article, we’ll explore how we can apply Permaculture design specifically to financial systems to create a genuinely regenerative economy.</p><p><strong>What is Financial Permaculture and How is it Applied?</strong></p><p>Financial Permaculture may be applied as a model for systems thinking that takes a whole ecosystem approach to economics. Financial Permaculture strives towards holistically optimized economic returns. Financial Permaculture is appropriate information technology. Appropriate refers to applying efficient designs that generate the least amount of waste for the highest yield. It takes into account the actual social and ecological costs within a local economy.

How can we focus on sustainable investing?</p>\n<p>The investing world can be intimidating at times, and specializing in just green and sustainable opportunities narrows the playing field quite a bit. However, there’s value in investing in, honoring and supporting a great cause aligned with your own morals and priorities.</p>\n<h2><strong>What Is Socially Responsible Investing?</strong></h2>\n<p>Although it’s a relatively new concept, socially responsible investing (SRI) has always been around. It involves building a portfolio with positive, responsible and sustainable companies. SRI is also growing substantially, with experts predicting it to be <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/14/your-complete-guide-to-socially-responsible-investing.html">a $50 trillion field</a> within the next 20 years.</p>\n<p>Also known as environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, it’s a strategy for supporting companies making the world better and healthier. Many proponents follow a grading scale, issued by third parties, independent companies and research groups that emphasize responsible initiatives. You can determine how much you’re willing to be involved with the three facets:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Environment:</strong> The impact a company has on the environment as a whole, including carbon footprint, toxic chemical and waste handling, manufacturing and beyond.\xa0</li><li><strong>Social:</strong> The social impact of a company’s operation both internally and externally — such as do they support racial diversity, do they help impoverished communities, do they have LGBTQ+ equality and supportive policies.</li><li><strong>Governance:</strong> How the executive team or board drives positive change and makes a difference.</li></ul>\n<p>Of course, true sustainability stretches far beyond these concepts. Being an economically, socially and ethically positive operation is worth striving towards in many ways.</p>\n<p>Socially responsible investing calls for understanding the impact a company has on one or all of these core factors, then choosing whether or not to invest. The goal is to build a portfolio that includes impactful operations. The trick, however, is finding well-run companies with a positive future, balanced spending and lots of potential. No one wants their portfolio to tank, certainly not because they made some avoidable choices.</p>\n<p>Using real estate investing as an anchor, considering how companies invest in local properties and evaluating the impact they have on the community — all of it relates to socially responsible investing. Passive real estate opportunities, putting money <a href="https://renovated.com/the-beginners-ultimate-guide-to-real-estate-investing/">into real estate investment trusts</a> (REIT), are also relevant.

Step one is conducting in-depth research into potential companies to understand sustainability ratings, as well as both social and economic impact.</p>\n<p>There are many factors to consider. Does the company own property and rent it out to tenants? Are they multi-family properties or single-residential homes? Are they converting apartments and condos to more traditional housing?

It\'s published under a Creative Commons licence (see side panel for details)</em></p>\n <p><em></em></p>\n <p> Finance, even in its most high-tech formulations, is rooted in ecological systems. A high-frequency trading hedge fund, for example, relies on electricity created by burning fossillised organic matter. It relies on employees, surviving via agricultural systems. It trades in company shares, given value by the actions of those companies’ employees using assets (like computers and telecommunications systems) that are all dependent (at some level) on mining, forestry, and other extractive industries.</p>\n <p> The financial system has been a net drain on ecological systems though. Finance involves steering economic energy – symbolised in money – in an attempt to generate a yield over time. For example, investors may steer money via financial instruments like shares and bonds into economic activities, and attempt to extract returns in the form of dividends and interest. They aim to extract the highest short-term yield, from the minimum amount of expenditure, preferably at the lowest possible levels of risk.</p>\n <p></p>\n <p>ALL YOUR ENERGY BELONG TO US</p>\n <p> Permaculture is a body of thought that attempts to build ecological dynamics into design. A permacultural designer entirely understands the idea of obtaining a yield from the earth by investing time and energy, but the key difference is that they attempt to do so without undermining ecological balance. The focus is on mutualistic integration with ecologies, acting in accordance with natural regenerative processes rather than parasitically exploiting them. So can we use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture#Twelve_design_principles"><strong>permacultural principles</strong></a> to design financial instruments and institutions?</p>\n <p><strong>Cultivating long term balance</strong></p>\n <p>A classic example of a parasitic financial institution is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payday_loans_in_the_United_Kingdom"><strong>payday lender</strong></a>. The payday loan company is fixated with the short-term risks presented by a vulnerable borrower, and exploits that by demanding the highest possible interest rate from them. In so doing they further exhaust the community around them and increase deprivation. It’s akin to overfishing an already fragile river system, thereby further disrupting the ecological balance.</p>\n <p> The permacultural designer, whether they are looking at fisheries or financial inclusion, will seek instead to build up the productive potential of the overall system. A permacultural financier thus looks to strengthen vulnerable borrowers, working with them to improve their credit-worthiness. The <a href="http://www.permaculturecu.org/"><strong>Permaculture Credit Union</strong></a> in Santa Fe is one such example of a regenerative financial institution. If we think in terms of economic energy, they aim to cultivate long-term energy balance, rather than extracting maximum short-term energy before collapse.</p>\n <p><strong>Observe and interact</strong></p>\n <p></p>\n <p> But how do we get to a point of designing such systems? Anyone familiar with permaculture knows that it has 12 principles of design. The first, and perhaps most important, principle is ‘observe and interact’. Mainstream financial institutions such as large banks pay little attention to the cultural nuances of the communities they descend upon, and their designers certainly do not interact with such communities in any meaningful sense. They offer standardised products and services, no matter where they are, and in areas where these don’t work, the banks are simply not found (known as ‘financial exclusion’).</p>\n <p> Alternative finance practitioners need to be attuned to the needs of their environment.

A few quick stats to illustrate this point:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From 1989 to 2021, the S&amp;P 500 would have performed better without fossil fuel stocks.</li>\n<li>In 1980, 29% of the market capitalization of the S&amp;P 500 (the 500 largest companies on US stock exchanges) were fossil fuel companies. As of the writing of this piece in February 2022, it represented just 3.52%.</li>\n<li>We would argue that fossil fuels are in a bubble — It’s a debt-heavy, capital-intensive industry. If the price of oil or natural gas drops too far or too much of their margin is needed to pay an escalating carbon tax (or a carbon tariff, like the<a href="https://voxeu.org/article/reflections-eu-s-carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism"> EU\'s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism</a>), thousands of sites will no longer be financially viable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dig deeper into the numbers behind divestment and climate-friendly investing in Chapter 3 where we explore the <a href="https://www.carboncollective.co/sustainable-investing/performance">performance of sustainable investing</a>.</p>\n<a></a>\n<h3>Climate Change Can\'t Be Solved Without Investment</h3>\n<p>Secondly, sustainable investing is necessary to solve climate change. Scientists, researchers, and engineers have set goals around decarbonization and laid out viable pathways to achieve these goals (some of our favorites: <a href="https://drawdown.org/">Project Drawdown</a>, <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050">IEA</a>, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/the-economic-transformation-what-would-change-in-the-net-zero-transition">McKinsey</a>). While these experts have minor differences, they all basically agree on the following: to solve climate change, we need to build a lot of stuff. We have to completely transition our global energy system to run without fossil fuels, from electricity to cars, ships, and industry.\xa0</p>\n<p>From solar panels to battery gigafactories to long-distance, high voltage power lines, this approach will require the creation of additional infrastructure for renewable energy. And such building takes investment. And that’s just the energy system; we need to do more in agriculture and the global supply chain.\xa0</p>\n<p>According to Project Drawdown and the Climate Policy Initiative, in 2019, the globe invested ~$600 billion into climate solutions. For humanity to achieve its target of "turning off the tap" by 2050, we need to invest closer to $5.2 trillion per year into climate solutions.</p>\n<p>That’s a lot of money. But here’s the good news:\xa0</p>\n<p>#1 Filling that investment gap isn’t charity. Much of it is already profitable, and the rest is on a path to being profitable soon.</p>\n<p>#2 We can solve climate change and we have most of the resources to do it.</p>\n<p>Sustainable investing is not only the most realistic path to solving climate change, but it is also <em>smart </em>investing.</p>\n<h2>Why Impact Investing is Important</h2>\n<p>To avoid catastrophic 1.5ºC warming, humanity needs to invest ~9x more into climate solutions each year. We need to research, develop, test, iterate, build, deploy, and massively scale up new technologies. And we need to deploy the existing clean technologies as fast as we can.\xa0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As touched on above, none of this, from early-stage R&amp;D to building the next battery gigafactory, will happen without investment to fund it.

These nations pledged to limit global warming to well below 2°C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. But half a decade on, the gap between commitment and real effort remains apparent.</p>\n<p>According to the latest report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), between 2020 and 2030 global coal, oil, and gas production would have to decline annually by 11%, 4%, and 3% respectively to be consistent with a 1.5°C pathway. Yet government plans and projections indicate an average 2% annual increase for each of these fuels. While the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures led to short-term drops in coal, oil, and gas production, pre-Covid plans and post-Covid stimulus measures point to a continuation of the growing global fossil fuel production gap, risking severe climate disruption.</p>\n<p>How can investors help? While the environmental challenges remain complex, good news comes from the fact that investors have shifted gears on the issue. According to the Climate Bond Initiative, by the end of October 2020, the yearly global green bond and loans market has reached $194.6 billion, with $46.4 billion (24%) of that bond issuance certified under the Climate Bonds Standard - a 9% increase from a year ago.</p>\n<p>Prominent bonds issued this year which were certified include sovereign green bonds issued by Chile and the Netherlands, major Chinese banks, car manufacturer Volkswagen and Japanese fast train network operator JRTT. Overall, certified green bonds and loans have now been issued by more than 160 organisations from 36 nations, influencing the green market’s directions toward best practice in both developed and emerging economies. The Climate Bond Initiative estimates that labelled green bond issuances should reached $350 billion in 2020, up from $265 billion issued in 2019.</p>\n<p>The country rankings for 2020 to the end of Q3 are led by USA (with $32.3 billion of green bonds issued), Germany ($21.4 billion) and France ($17.8 billion).

This involves mobilising some of the $125trn accumulated in the global bond market.<sup>1</sup> That's a lot of money - and a lot of potential climate impact stored up, ready to deploy.</p>\n<p>We're talking about ‘green bonds', a relatively new but booming segment of the bond market. Green bonds offer investors a way to direct some of their capital towards climate projects. The rationale for including them in portfolios is stronger than ever.</p>\n<h3>Investing with purpose</h3>\n<p>When you buy a normal or ‘vanilla' bond, you're lending your money to the issuing company or government with no strings attached. The issuer uses the proceeds for an unspecified purpose, and pays a coupon on the bond in return. Eventually - in most cases - you get your principal (loan) back.</p>\n<p>Green bonds, in contrast, raise money for a\xa0<strong>specified</strong>\xa0purpose. For a bond to be certified as green, its proceeds must help fund climate or environmental projects. So, unlike with a vanilla bond, you will always know where your money is going. You can think of it as financing with ‘green strings attached'.</p>\n<p>A green bond could be financing a new windfarm, or a project to increase a low-lying town's flood resilience, or a train station refurbishment which boosts public transport use - any of a wealth of projects that will go on to benefit the environment in a specific, tangible way.</p>\n<p>Put simply, green bonds offer much more transparency and measurability than normal bonds. Yet they still fly under the radar for many investors. Many, that is, but not all. Away from the mainstream, the green bond market has been booming in popularity.</p>\n<h3>Why green bonds are going mainstream</h3>\n<p>Speak to any climate activist and you'll hear the fight against climate change is slow - too slow. One reason why is because climate projects need to be financed, and there hasn't been a good mechanism for connecting investor cash with the green projects that need it most.</p>\n<div><p>Let's consider for a moment what climate-action or mitigation projects involve. This could be capital expenditure for new infrastructure, or major changes to existing systems, or investment in developing technologies. It all costs money, and sometimes that money is hard to find.</p><p>\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0But it's not an act of charity - these are investments, and so they come with a return. Just like their vanilla counterparts, green bonds pay a coupon. After all, a windfarm will generate and sell electricity. A new transport hub will process thousands of paying passengers. Flood resilience is worth paying for today if it reduces future costs. Investing in the energy transition is still investing.</p></div>\n<p>That's why, even putting environmental concerns aside, green bonds can be an attractive investment. They offer returns and diversify portfolio risk while contributing to climate action in a measurable way. And they are being rapidly snapped up by investors waking up to the fact that environmental benefits don't have to come at a premium.</p>\n<h3>Investors are waking up to the potential</h3>\n<p>Green bonds are still a small part of the giant global bond market, but they're on a very strong growth trajectory. The left-hand chart below shows cumulative labelled green bond issuance globally. This crossed the $1.5trn threshold in 2021, having hit $1trn as recently as 2020.</p>\n<p>The right-hand chart shows cumulative flows into green bond ETFs domiciled in Europe. We can see a similar shape emerge, one which has been referred to as exponential growth by Climate Bonds Initiative, an organisation mobilising capital for climate action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The issuer mix for green bonds (the proportion of green bond issuers that are corporate, sovereign, local government, etc.) is very different from the overall bond", datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

By serving each organization’s needs and simultaneously streamlining what each must accomplish, these partnerships help move innovative — and fully compliant — products to market.</p>\n<p>The right partnerships, leveraging full-stack and customizable fintech platforms, eliminate potential roadblocks. Equally important is re-thinking what partnerships look like, and the number of players they involve.</p>\n<p>First let’s examine some of the myths in this area.</p>\n<h2>Myth 1: Financial Institutions Can Build Their Own Digital Solutions</h2>\n<p>The overwhelming majority of traditional financial institutions don’t have the teams they need to build, launch, and maintain digital banking services, especially when they’re competing with fintech startups like Acorns, Qapital, MoneyLion, and others. Traditional players frequently lack expertise in product design, digital marketing, customer experience, and more. Conversely, the nonbank players built their companies on redefining an experience — and they started with both the people and expertise to do so.</p>\n<p>Rather than attempting to compete where they don’t have competitive advantage, traditional players should consider partnering with such fintechs so they can reap the benefits they afford. These include opening new accounts and raising new deposits.</p>\n<h2>Myth 2: Partnerships Suck Up Time and Resources</h2>\n<p>Within the traditional model of a bank interfacing directly with a fintech, it’s true that most banks nationwide haven’t staffed teams dedicated to managing partnerships.</p>\n<p>But there are solutions that take the onus off of banks and fintechs to do that — essentially, firms that serve as a bridge between the partners.

This is an unusual view that deals with how market makers manipulate crowd behavior.</p>\n<p>Not to recount the book, so in this series of articles, we will focus on the practical side of the method with a traditional reference to cryptocurrency trading. You can apply this method to any financial instrument, my examples will be in the BTCUSD pair.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s discuss the theoretical principles of price formation in the market and how large capital traders influence the market. I will define the main concepts that I will use throughout the course. Therefore, you should study this article if you are interested in VSA and want to better understand the actions of large traders.</p>\n<h3>What are Trading Volumes?</h3>\n<p>Even if you’re just starting your trading career, you’ve probably found the following phrase: “The market goes up when demand prevails oversupply. And, on the contrary, the market will suffer a decline at the moment when supply is surpassing demand”. We need to study the principles suggested by this phrase in order to better understand what the volume of trade means.</p>\n<p>For those who could not find a similar term, I must explain that, in trading, is the number of lots traded on the market within a specific period. Firstly, it should be understood that the volume taken in isolation does not provide much information. But, if what we do is compare the current volume with the previous day’s volume, or a week earlier…, you will see clearly the changes in business activity.</p>\n<p>To better understand market processes, let us compare a change in volume with the price differential. This will show the feeling of the great players: bullies or bassists. Remember, the spread is the difference between high and low prices during a particular period.</p>\n<p>In practice, price movements do not always correspond to current market activity. There are often cases where, after a small increase in volume, the price increases sharply, confusing many traders. But if you have already studied the concept of inertia, then you will have everything clearer. Then, in this situation, the market can be compared to a car in which driving at high speed will go uphill for a while, even if the driver has taken his foot off the accelerator.</p>\n<h3>What is Volume Spread Analysis?</h3>\n<p>The VSA method provides a complex approach to market analysis, which defines the relationships between asset price, spread, and volume. The last indicator shows the activity in the market. While the spread speaks of the amplitude of the price movement.</p>\n<p>In establishing the relationships between these two characteristics, we strive to identify the imbalance between demand and supply. For the most part, it is a consequence of transactions opened by large operators, and in the trading environment, it is considered one of the most significant reasons for the market to move in one direction or another. In turn, knowing the imbalance and the true causes of its occurrence, we can easily predict the direction of future price movement.</p>\n<h3>Principles for the Movement of Assets</h3>\n<p>Volumes, like stock market trends, are also divided into bullish and bearish. The bullish volume increases the volume in the upward movements and decreases the volume in the downward movements. Consequently, the bearish volume increases the volume in downward movements and decreases the volume in upward movements.</p>\n<p>Now let us examine the concepts of accumulation and distribution…</p>\n<p>Cumulation means buying as many shares as possible, without significantly increasing the price compared to your own purchase, until there are few or no shares available at the price level you have been buying. This purchase usually occurs after a bearish move in the stock market and there are the best prices to buy.</p>\n<p>Once most shares have been removed from the hands of other traders (ordinary natural persons), there won’t be much action left to sell at an additional price. In other words, resistance to the bullish movement has been neutralized', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

It is an insightful tool that gives detailed information on when the market opened/closed, and what was its high/close prices for that specific period.</p>\n<h3>Components of a Candlestick</h3>\n<p>Candlesticks are essentially made of three components. These components determine the open, close, high, and low.</p>\n<p>The three components of a candlestick are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Wick – the highest point in the candlestick determining the high price (thin part at top)</li>\n<li>Body – the area between open and close determining the open price and close price (thick part)</li>\n<li>Tail – the lowest point in the market determining the low price (thin part at bottom)</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p><h3>Types of candlesticks</h3>\n<p>Based on the direction of the price action, candlesticks can be of two types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bullish candlestick - price may go up</li>\n<li>Bearish candlestick - price may go down</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bullish Candlestick</h3>\n<p>A bullish candlestick can be defined as a candlestick whose close price is greater than the open price. In other words, it is a candlestick whose price action is in an upward trajectory.</p>\n<p>To interpret the components of a bullish candlestick, let’s consider the below figure. The market opened at $100, the price dropped to $50, shot right back up to $200, and finally closed $50 lower (at $150). Thus, the area between Open and Close ($100 and $150) becomes the body, while the highest price ($200) and lowest price ($50) becomes the High and Low respectively.</p>\n<p>Initially, the market was trading at $100. Later, since there were not enough buyers at this price, the market dropped to $50. From this level, the price started to rise because the buyers were willing to purchase the asset at a higher and higher price. As a result, the market closed at $150, higher than the open price, indicating that the bulls are in control of the market.</p>\n<p></p><h3>Bearish Candlestick</h3>\n<p>A bearish candlestick is the other type of candlestick where the close price is lower than the open price. The price action of such a candlestick is downwards. </p>\n<p>Consider the below figure representing a bearish candlestick. Comparing this with the bullish candlestick, the first observation that can be made out is the colour of the candlestick. Secondly, it is seen that the Close is below the Open. However without the colour you wouldnt know which was which</p>\n<p>The market opened at $150, tried to go higher up to $200 but got rejected and came right back down. This implies that there is pressure coming in from the sellers. Later, the market crashes to $50 and closes at $100. Since the closing price is lower than the opening price, it indicates that the bears are in control of the market.</p>\n<p></p><h3>The Candlestick Timeframes</h3>\n<p>Candlesticks are that tool which allows all types of traders to analyze and make trading decisions. In other words, candlesticks are useful to both short-term traders and long-term traders. This advantage comes from the variable timeframes in candlesticks.</p>\n<p>Timeframes are a crucial factor to consider while analyzing the markets. Timeframes can get confusing at times because single asset can show different stories on a different timeframe. However, if you stick to either short-term or long-term, the speculation can be simplified.</p>\n<h4>What are timeframes in candlesticks?</h4>\n<p>A timeframe on a candlestick chart defines the period of a candlestick.

These three indicators are not the same, so don’t rely on them alone. Take a look at each and learn what you can use to trade in crypto better. If you’re new to crypto, <strong>volume spread analysis</strong> may seem like a daunting task. But don’t despair! With the right training, it can help you make the most of it.</p>\n<h2>Volume spread analysis</h2>\n<p>Traders using Volume Spread Analysis (VSA) are able to detect trends. It is an important part of the analysis process because it is useful in tracking price changes. However, there are certain limitations to VSA. Traders should use the method with caution as there are several variables that should be taken into account. A bullish bar, for example, has a small candlestick size and the closing price is near the low. The price action of the bar is usually up, but a bullish bar shows strong selling pressure.</p>\n<p>VSA is a proven methodology developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wyckoff">Richard D. Wyckoff</a> in the 1900s and perfected by Tom Williams, a London syndicate trader. Many successful Wall Street traders have used VSA to find patterns in the markets. VSA is based on supply and demand as well as pure price and volume action. It can help a trader trade with the pros by revealing patterns that can be used to make profitable decisions.</p>\n<p>A bullish sign is one where volume is higher than the price. Conversely, a bearish sign means the volume is lower. A bullish candlestick pattern is characterized by light and heavy volume. A small price range and little or no movement in volume is a sign that a reversal is on the way. Nevertheless, heavy volumes indicate that a price is a bullish sign and may signal a reversal.</p>\n<h2>Candlestick patterns</h2>\n<p>One of the most important things to know about volume spread analysis in crypto is how to use candlestick patterns. Candlesticks are similar to square lollipops and have specific criteria that are met in order for a pattern to be valid. The candlestick pattern is most effective for identifying market tops and bottoms and is the basis for many different volume spread strategies. You can use it to trade in any timeframe including minutely and hourly cycles.</p>\n<p>A candlestick is a pattern of price movement that has four specific points: the open, the low,high and the close or OHLC. The candles form a picture of price movement within a particular time period. Depending on the time frame used, a candlestick may form a bullish or bearish pattern. It is important to understand that these patterns are indicative of historical tendencies, and they cannot be used as a predictor of future prices or market movement.</p>\n<p>Volume spread analysis is based on a candlestick model and uses four main market phases to predict market trends. Volume bars progress in cycles, each cycle representing one volume climax. The candlestick model is based on a bullish or bearish pattern that represents a market’s strength or weakness. The candlestick pattern is the most important part of volume spread analysis, and it is very useful for traders and investors.</p>\n<h2>On-balance volume (OBV)</h2>\n<p>Before we dive into on-balance volume in crypto, let’s take a look at volume. In financial markets, volume represents the number of shares bought and sold during a specified period of time. This can be a day, week, or year, depending on how you measure volume. In the cryptocurrency world, volume is measured by how many trades are made for a given cryptocurrency and how much currency changes hands per trade.</p>\n<p>This indicator is helpful in identifying reversals and confirm reversals. When price and on-balance volume diverge, this may indicate a downward breakout. Conversely, a rising OBV line can confirm an upward breakout. If the trend continues, higher volume and price action may indicate an imminent breakout. In the graph below, you can see a possible divergence alert. On-balance volume is a great tool for traders who want to confirm the direction of the trend.</p>\n<p', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

And what other factors are creating the cocktail of taxation hitting homeowners this year?</p><p>Let’s break it down.</p><h3>Why are my property taxes going way up?</h3><p>In short, your tax bill is most likely going up for at least one of these three reasons:</p><p>• About 90 taxing entities across the state — from cities and towns to water districts and libraries — are seeking property tax rate hikes this year, so chances are pretty good that your wallet will feel the sting of one or more of those increases.</p><p>• The valuation of your home could be increasing your bill. Because home values are skyrocketing — much faster than those of commercial properties — homeowners are carrying more of the revenue burden.</p><p>• An education funding law adopted by the Utah Legislature in 2018 is interfering with a mechanism in the state’s truth-in-taxation law from the 1980s, leading to higher payments than you would have to make under normal circumstances. It has affected taxpayers since it passed, but increased valuations have exacerbated the payments this year.</p><h3>But first, let’s unravel Utah’s truth-in-taxation law</h3><p>This law sets up a system that allows taxing jurisdictions (think cities, counties, school districts, water districts) to receive only the amount of revenue they collected the year before, plus whatever taxes they got from new development in their jurisdiction.</p><p>Because of those constraints, when property values in a jurisdiction rise, tax rates automatically adjust downward to offset the additional revenue that the taxing entity would have collected from appreciation.</p><p>If a taxing jurisdiction wants to create additional revenue to pay for things like new public safety services or water infrastructure, officials in that jurisdiction would need to hold a truth-in-taxation hearing.</p><p>Those hearings put governing bodies in the political hot seat, forcing officials to explain to the public why they want to raise property tax rates. They usually attract an abundance of opposition, and that political blowback often prevents, or at least reduces, major tax increases.</p><p>About half the time, entities that seek a rate hike back off their initial proposals, according to <a href="https://tax.utah.gov/commission-office">John Valentine</a>, chair of the Utah State Tax Commission.</p><h3>How are home values affecting property tax bills?</h3><p>Taxing jurisdictions look at property tax revenue as a whole, not on a category-by-category basis.</p><p>Utah’s housing market is booming, and the value of residential properties shot up exponentially more than commercial properties, many of which are seeing sluggish growth coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Many businesses don’t want to “buy an office building right now because everybody’s dealing (with) remote work,” Valentine said. “So your value didn’t increase very much, or even maybe went down.”</p><p>Because home', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

In this article, we will learn how these changes make permanent life insurance more attractive as an investment.</p><h3><strong>What is IRS Section 7702?</strong><br /></h3><p>Section 7702 are IRS rules that decide how life insurance is taxed. The last time it was updated in a major way was in the 1980s, when legislators wanted to stop people from abusing the tax advantages of the asset class by limiting how quickly they could put money into a policy, and making sure that people bought life insurance not only as a way of saving on taxes but also for the insurance itself.Â\xa0</p><p>These changes introduced the concept of a <em>Modified Endowment Contract (MEC), </em>which is a classification that certain policies could get which removes all of their tax advantages on withdrawals from the policies.Â\xa0</p><p>The main factor that affects whether a policy gets a MEC classification is how aggressively funded it is, which is decided by comparing the premium size to the size of the death benefit.Â\xa0</p><h3><strong>How the Funding Limitations WorkÂ\xa0</strong><br /></h3><p>Whenever you are paying premiums for a permanent life insurance policy, you are generally paying for two things:<strong> </strong>the <strong>death benefit</strong> (ie. money that is paid out once the insured dies), and the <strong>living benefits</strong> (ie. cash value that is built up inside the policy, similar to an investment account).</p><p>When you are buying a permanent life insurance primarily as an investment, you want as much of your money as possible to go towards the cash value, and as little as possible towards the death benefit.Â\xa0</p><p>The limitations in the 7702 rules limit the amount of the premium that can go towards the living benefits versus the death benefit.</p><p>The exact ratio of this will vary by age, health, product type, and more, but in general, the rules limit the speed at which you can build cash value from premiums on a policy with a certain death benefit.Â\xa0</p><p>Essentially, these limitations make sure that you canâ\x80\x99t maintain your tax advantages if too much of your premium is going towards the living benefits.Â\xa0</p><h3><strong>How the 7702 rules has ChangedÂ\xa0</strong><br /></h3><p>While the specific details of the changes in the 7702 section are quite complex, the general effect that they have is that they allow a larger portion of the premium to go towards the living benefits versus the death benefits.Â\xa0</p><p>This means that with these new rules, policies can now be structured in such a way that more premium goes towards living benefits, which allows you to build cash value in your policy quicker.Â\xa0</p><p>For people using permanent life insurance primarily as an investment, this means that they can now fund their policies more efficiently, and buy less life insurance coverage in comparison to the cash value buildup.</p><p>For people using permanent life insurance primarily for the coverage, the new rules might not necessarily be good, as some policies will require a higher premium to be paid for the same death benefit as before the rule changes.Â\xa0</p><p>To understand this better, letâ\x80\x99s take a birdâ\x80\x99s-eye view at the factors involved in section 7702.</p><h3><strong>Understanding the Change in Actuarial Interest Rate Assumptions</strong><br /></h3><p>The structure of life insurance policies are set by statisticians called actuaries, which uses things like life expectancy and interest rate assumptions to set prices for life insurance coverage.</p><p>If, for example, an actuary knows that a pool of clients are expected to live for another 40 years, and that they will yield 5 % on the money they manage, they can use that information to decide what the premium should be for a certain individual of that pool.Â\xa0</p><p>When the original 7702 rules were introduced, in the 1980s, interest rates around the world were much higher, which was reflected in the guidelines set around the interest rates that the actuaries can assume.</p><p>In these times, an', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Changes to the federal tax code, of course. And 2016 is no exception.</p>\n<p>These changes could mean big financial penalties if you don\'t have health insurance. Or they could bring you big savings if you happen to own a small business. Overall, the changes to the tax code that Congress enacted last year are beneficial to consumers, according to Dave Du, vice president of consumer advocacy at TaxAudit.com.</p>\n<p>"With just days to go before the end of the year, Congress finally extended most of the tax breaks which were set to expire," Du said. "Some of these provisions — like the definition of racehorse as property — won\'t impact too many of us, but there\'s much good news for taxpayers this year."</p>\n<p>One example? You can file later this year. The deadline for filing your income taxes this year is April 18 instead of April 15, thanks to something called Emancipation Day in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>Here are five other big tax changes you should be prepared for this year.</p>\n<h2>1. A Climbing Health Insurance Penalty</h2>\n<p>One of the bigger changes to the tax code this year is actually a punitive one: An increase in the penalty for not having health insurance that meets the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>Micah Fraim, a Roanoke, Virginia-based Certified Public Accountant, said that for the 2015 tax year — those are the taxes you\'ll be filing by April 18 — filers will have to pay a penalty of $325 for every uninsured adult and $162.50 for every uninsured dependent child, or 2% of your taxable income — whichever number is greater.</p>\n<p>That\'s a significant increase. For the 2014 tax year, those numbers stood at $95 and $47.50, or 1% of your taxable income. "And in 2016, it gets even worse," Friedman said.</p>\n<p>For the 2016 tax year — the taxes you will file by April of 2017 — the penalty for not having insurance rises to $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, or 2.5% of your income. The message is clear: If you don\'t have acceptable health insurance, it\'s time to get it. (See also:\xa0<a href="http://www.wisebread.com/avoid-these-5-costly-health-insurance-mistakes">Avoid These 5 Costly Health Insurance Mistakes</a>)</p>\n<h2>2. New Health Insurance Forms</h2>\n<p>You can also expect to receive a new form or two in the mail relating to health insurance. If you\'ve purchased health insurance through the federal government\'s Health Insurance Marketplace, you\'ll receive Form 1095-A. This isn\'t a change — the government began mailing this form out for the 2014 tax year.</p>\n<p>But there are two new health insurance forms for the 2015 tax year. Form 1095-B is a statement from your health insurance company verifying that you and other members of your household have insurance coverage that meets the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. This form is only sent to taxpayers who get their insurance from somewhere other than the Health Insurance Marketplace, such as from their employer. Form 1095-C is a statement from your employer that provides details about your employer-sponsored health benefits.</p>\n<p>Many taxpayers will receive both 1095-B and 1095-C, of course. The key fact to realize? You probably won\'t have to do anything with these forms, said Andrew Oswalt, Certified Public Account for Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based TaxACT.</p>\n<p>"The new forms could be confusing because most people will think they have to do something with them," Oswalt said. "The reality is, they\'ll simply need to mark a checkbox on their Form 1040 when filing and keep the forms 1095-B and 1095-C for their records."</p>\n<h2>3. A Tax Break for Small Business Owners</h2>\n<p>Priyanka Prakash, finance specialist at loan-search service FitBiz Loans, said that small business owners need to be aware of Section 179 of the tax code — a new tax law that lets them deduct up to $500,000 of qualifying equipment on their tax returns.</p>\n<p>To qualify for this', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Venture capital firms will start to pick insurtech leaders</h2>\n<p>There’s strong demand for insurance technology investments in the VC community right now. <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/insurance-tech-startup-funding-2015/">According to CB Insights</a>, there was $2.65 billion in VC investments in insurtech companies in 2015, about three-and-a-half times the amount invested in similar companies the prior year.</p>\n<p>This makes sense too. Insurance is one of the remaining industries that hasn’t yet taken a huge, technology-based step forward and VCs are finally realizing the potential impact technology could have on how it’s bought, sold and administered.</p>\n<p>So, while there has been a massive demand for insurance investments from the VC community, beyond employee benefits, the actual pace of investment has been relatively low due to an almost complete lack of investment opportunities with attractive business models, proven teams, and productive uses for their capital.</p>\n<p>Even including benefits, while $2.65 billion is a lot of money, it’s a small percentage of the $128.5 billion in VC money that was raised last year.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the next year, we’ll see a few strong financial models emerge from companies who took seed rounds over the last 18 months that will attract sizable Series A rounds to fund growth and establish leads in their market segments.</p>\n<p>The noise and buzz around insurtech has already spawned a growing number of me-too copycats and business model clones but, as has happened with other formerly hot sectors for venture capital- the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-03/uber-raises-funding-at-62-5-valuation">on-demand economy</a> and marketplace lending- the benefits of scale and access to capital will accrue almost entirely to the innovative first movers.</p>\n<h2>2. Carriers will start more meaningful partnerships with startups to drive innovation</h2>\n<p>You can bet that all carriers are already having discussions about this in their boardrooms right now, it’s reflected in strategic VC investments even if not yet in meaningful operating partnerships, but over the next year we’ll see which carriers will actually pull the trigger on deals – be it acquisitions or partnerships – that lean on startups to help them jumpstart the pace of innovation inside the company.</p>\n<p>We’ve started to see <a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2016/03/21/big-banks-balance-fintech-startup-partnerships-with-internal-innovation/">meaningful partnerships with technology companies from the large banks</a> only recently, but there is reason to think that insurers will move faster.</p>\n<p>Most of this activity will happen around finding new means of distribution, new ways to help claims adjusting, big data analysis for underwriting, and early efforts at incorporating <a href="https://www.embroker.com/blog/iot-insurance/">the Internet of Things</a>.</p>\n<p>It will be a fairly incredible thing to see for a couple reasons: first, it will be impressive to see massive companies', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

It has found fault with laws protecting public health, the environment, workers’ rights, and other things that would affect industries’ bottom line. Recent rulings have objected to producers labeling certain kinds of tuna as “dolphin safe;” the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s ban on sweet-flavored cigarettes that entice kids; and labels that inform consumers what country meat products originated in. The WTO says such labels violate the rights of Mexican and Canadian farmers to a level playing field. The United States sometimes refuses to comply—but risks trade sanctions when it does so.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most frightening of all, the WTO (along with NAFTA) has spawned a whole new brood of bilateral and regional deals that take the same approach to trade and development.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, if approved, would promote trade between the United States and the European Union.</p>\n<p>The deal has some bright spots—for example, it would universalize the plugs for electric cars.\xa0But American negotiators are also pushing hard to overturn Europe’s ban on imports of U.S.-grown genetically modified crops. Meanwhile, European negotiators and bankers are trying to set Wall Street free from regulations passed after the financial crisis of 2008. <a href="https://www.citizen.org/documents/TAFTA-financial-factsheet.pdf">According to the nonprofit research group Public Citizen</a>, they want to roll back the Volcker Rule, which restricts U.S. banks from the riskiest investments, and to block efforts to limit the size of banks.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>When President Bill Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada in 1993,', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

The Biden administration is pursuing a course correction and looking inward for economic security. Many other nations are taking this approach. Even some businesses recognize that the risk of disruption brought about by extreme globalization doesn’t justify the allure of weak regulation and low labor costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite this shift, a great deal of global trade will continue, under different rules. The task of the next decade is to figure out what those rules will look like. Is there a path back to a trading system that allows nation-states more room to govern capitalism, as in the Bretton Woods era? Can the successor system offer a better deal to developing countries of the Global South? Might a new trade regime give more weight to climate goals, labor rights, public health, or public provision of goods? And where does China fit in?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next trade regime will not be a single universal set of rules, as the WTO’s sponsors imagined. It will be a hybrid that could provide more space to pursue progressive economic and social policies, nationally and globally, if we don’t succumb to the lingering influence of trade traditionalists in government and their allies on Wall Street.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Corrupted Ideology Meets Corrupted Institutions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By hyper-globalization, I mean the premise that cross-border trade and capital movements should be free from regulatory restraints and national industrial policies. This became the new definition of “free trade” and the object of intense U.S. diplomacy beginning in the 1980s. After 1990, this vision was codified in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and in dozens of bilateral deals. Promoters of the shift invoked economic theory, but in practice it was driven by the corporate push to use trade rules aggressively to undermine national regulation of capitalism, from banking (rebranded as “trade in financial services”) to industry-created pollution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NAFTA allowed corporations to sue in special courts to challenge health, safety, and environmental regulations as incursions on their trading rights. Within the EU, long-standing guarantees of collective bargaining were overturned as impinging on the cross-border rights of capital. WTO rules became obstacles to distributing free or cheap vaccines in a worldwide pandemic. Hyper-globalization was the global face of neoliberalism, as well as its enforcer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the start, the system was a bundle of contradictions. Western leaders who sponsored this shift knew from their national experience that unregulated markets are far from efficient. For almost a century, nations dealt with the anomalies of markets by regulating finance, labor, health, and the environment. They used industrial and research subsidies and public ownership to help their economies develop. Wherever nations failed to regulate, capitalism created gross inequality and environmental disasters, as well as periodic financial bubbles, systemic crashes, and prolonged depressions. But through some mysterious alchemy, when commerce crossed borders, unregulated markets were supposedly efficient after all. Free-traders never explained the inconsistency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://prospect.org/topics/robert-kuttner/"><strong><em>More from Robert Kuttner</em></strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the dominant consensus toward “most favored nation” treatment, all nations were to get the same access to each other’s markets, with no special deals. But the principle of equal access was increasingly honored in the breach. After the collapse of multilateral trade negotiations in Seattle in 1999, the U.S. moved increasingly to bilateral deals known as free trade agreements (FTAs), typically with export-dependent Third World countries. The basic template was to demand that the client country give U.S.-based corporations access on the terms they wanted, and in return the lucky country’s products got preferential entry to the U.S. market.

The length and the language serve as an effective deterrence against broader public scrutiny.<br /></p>\n<p>But what’s hidden here is much worse: a largely bipartisan trade-policy consensus in the United States, reaching back at least to the passage of NAFTA in 1994, that enriches transnational corporations and the 1 percent, while screwing over ordinary people in all sorts of ways. There’s a lot to decipher, but it’s worth the effort. Here are nine reasons why:</p>\n<h4>1. CONTEMPORARY TRADE AGREEMENTS ARE ABOUT PRETTY MUCH EVERY ISSUE YOU CARE ABOUT.</h4>\n<p>These agreements don’t just set tariffs and other trade restrictions. They may end up governing the\xa0<a href="http://www.world-psi.org/en/trade-agreements-put-our-right-water-risk">quality of your water</a>. They’re about the\xa0<a href="https://www.citizenstrade.org/ctc/blog/2019/03/28/nafta-2-0-would-lock-in-high-medicine-prices/">price of your medications</a>. They’re about\xa0<a href="https://openmedia.org/en/nafta-20-and-digital-rights-good-bad-and-worst">free downloads</a>\xa0and public services like the\xa0<a href="https://www.citizenstrade.org/ctc/trade-issues/trade-in-services/">postal service</a>\xa0and\xa0<a href="https://www.ciel.org/fracking-dispute-under-nafta-highlights-potential-pitfalls-of-eu-u-s-trade-agreement/">fracking</a>\xa0and… well, you get the idea. Unsurprisingly, these decisions tend to be made in favor of the few and at the expense of the many.</p>\n<p>What’s more, tariffs for most goods have actually been harmonized and governed with relatively little drama by the World Trade Organization for decades. There are a few goods that are not covered, and occasional disputes do arise, but\xa0<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/us/politics/trump-border-closing-economy.html">the price of avocados</a>\xa0is determined much more by market speculation and/or nationalist saber rattling than by anything that does or does not appear in the agreements now being negotiated.</p>\n<p>So, while avocados might get the media coverage, it’s the boring stuff like your country’s ability to set its own public-health and environmental regulations that sits at the core of these documents.</p>\n<h4>2. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE ALSO DEEPLY UNDEMOCRATIC AND HARD TO ROLL BACK.</h4>\n<p>Trade agreements are the most deeply undemocratic policy area that exists today. Negotiations are held behind closed doors with invitations typically extended only to technocrats and corporate lobbyists. Draft texts are generally not available to the public, and through a lovely process known as “<a href="https://www.citizen.org/our-work/globalization-and-trade/alternatives-corporate-globalization/fast-track-presidential-trade">Fast Track</a>,” Congress must vote on the final product as a whole without being able to review, object to, or propose changes.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, since NAFTA was first adopted in the 1990s, most agreements have included “investor-state dispute settlement” mechanisms that allow corporations to sue governments for infringing on profit-making opportunities. These lawsuits are decided by special courts composed of unelected judges that, unsurprisingly, tend to side with corporations.</p>\n<p>ISDS, as it’s commonly called,', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Also in the works are the U.S.-EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, binding China and 15 other major Asian economies.</p><p>If they all get done, these agreements would span 49 countries and a huge share of global economic output.</p><p>Forgotten in all the excitement is the awkward truth that 111 of the World Trade Organization\'s 160 member countries are not part of these megaregionals. Most of the developing world will be entirely shut out. India, Brazil and all of Africa aren\'t even at the table.</p><p>The architecture for a new world order in trade is being crafted and rolled out, and these countries will be denied a voice and a foot in the door. And that\'s a shame, says Harsha Singh, a long-time senior WTO official, who was deputy director-general from 2005 to 2013.</p><p>"The world is getting more interdependent, with trade and investment becoming two sides of the same coin," Mr. Singh said in an interview. "If we don\'t have an inclusive system, whatever system we put in place is going to create tensions and potential conflicts."</p><p>The developing world was the destination for 56 per cent of all foreign direct investment last year, pointed out Mr. Singh, now a fellow at both the Geneva-based International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development and the Winnipeg-based International Institute for Sustainable Development. It\'s also home to a burgeoning middle class, which will grow by a billion people this decade.</p><p>"A young generation will grow up with the knowledge that they are not part of the system," Mr. Singh lamented. "There will be very strong resentment."</p><p>The megaregionals are designed to create business value chains, by giving preferences on tariffs and rules-of-origin to those inside, while denying them to others.</p><p>The hope of Canada and other countries involved in these megaregionals is that they will become stepping stones to a broader global free-trade deal, reviving the long-stalled Doha round of negotiations.</p><p>Mr. Singh is more pessimistic. Countries, and companies, will quickly adapt their supply chains to take advantage of the lower tariffs, rules and standards within the newly created zones. The standards that exist within these areas will become increasingly difficult for outsiders to meet, creating a barrier rather than a transition to global free trade.</p><p>"Either you meet the standard, or you start losing market share," he explained.</p><p>These megaregionals would eventually link four main hubs of economic activity – the United States, Europe, Japan and China. Countries will either be in, or out, according to Mr. Singh.</p><p>Those left outside must work now to forge links with these four powerful hubs, while modernizing their trade regimes to ensure they don\'t fall behind.</p><p>The rise of megaregionals was probably inevitable. WTO countries have tried without success since 2001 to reignite global free-trade talks, bogged down on issues such as agricultural subsidies. And so countries looked for other ways to expand free trade.</p><p>Megaregionals are an answer, but they are not the ultimate solution.</p><p>Canada has targeted trade expansion into lesser-developed countries as part of its 2013 Global Markets Action Plan. The plan identifies 21 emerging markets that offer the "best potential for broad Canadian commercial interests," including many of the key economies shut out of the megaregionals, such as India, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey and the Philippines.</p><p>For several years now, most of Canada\'s trade negotiating effort has been directed at agreements with advanced economies.</p><p>It would be easy to blame developing countries for torpedoing the Doha round and foot-dragging on economic reforms. But protectionist farm groups in the United States, Japan and Canada are also at fault.</p><p>A third of the world may well migrate toward a new architecture in trade.</p><', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Michael Perelman gave a wide-ranging talk in Ankara called the Anarchy of Globalization which focused on the local impact of globalization. The presentation was wideranging and included a discussion of the evolution of usage and theoretical concerns. </p>\n<p>We’ve extracted a section below, on the role of “free trade” agreements and one of their not-widely-recognized side effects, that of weakening food security. The case study is Mexico. </p>\n<p><em><strong>By Michael Perelman, a professor of economics at California State University, Chico who also writes at <a href="https://michaelperelman.wordpress.com/">Unsettling Economics</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>Judging by the official discourse about globalization, one might imagine that we are witnessing a natural evolution of free trade that benefits everybody touched by globalization, as in Thomas Friedman’s vision of the flat world. In truth, much of the pressure to intensify globalization does not necessarily come from market successes, but often comes from disappointment in market outcomes. Dissatisfied that markets were not providing sufficient profits, powerful states adopted a strategy of pressuring their weaker counterparts to join in so called free trade deals.</p>\n<p> In fact, free trade is, at best, a secondary consideration of the trade agreements. For example, tariffs on trade between the U.S. and Europe are only 3.5 percent. A treaty to eliminate such tariffs would not be of great importance certainly one that would not involve strong diplomatic pressure and threats.</p>\n<p> In contrast, free trade agreements put enormous emphasis on intellectual property agreements, which are antithetical to trade, in general, because they grant monopoly status, which allows suppliers to set their own price without competition. In this sense, intellectual property is a violation of sacred market principles, according to which the price of a good should be the cost of producing one more unit, what economists call “marginal costs.” Intellectual property, however, generally costs virtually nothing to reproduce. Because of this violation of free market principles inherent in intellectual property, libertarians including libertarian economists had long opposed patents and copyrights, although less so now that few libertarians are leery of excessive corporate powers. Free trade treaties’ treatment of intellectual property is more accurately described as a transfer of power, rather than a promotion of free trade. Such intellectual property agreements can threaten public health. For example, people in impoverished countries cannot afford the exorbitant costs of pharmaceuticals. Diseases that could be relatively easily contained have more room to spread.</p>\n<p> Free trade treaties include investment dispute provisions, adjudicated by a tribunal made up of judges (generally with strong corporate ties). In other words, they have a better understanding of corporate interests rather than a typical body of law.</p>\n<p> Under many such treaties, corporations have the right to expect a static regulatory framework. In other words, the tribunals can find new regulations illegal because a corporation could not have predicted them when it first began planning its investment. At the same time, corporations are free to change their corporate policies. There is a surge of cases in which corporations have sued under this provision. Even when a country’s preexisting regulations prevent an investment, such creating a toxic waste, the company can take the government before a tribunal. They almost always win such cases.

Trade between the two blocs already amounts to €1 trillion a year.

The agreement is designed to stimulate economic activity by tearing down “barriers” to trade, ostensibly making everybody richer.

Discussions started in 2013 with the stated aim of concluding next year, but are now expected to run until at least 2017.</p>\n<p><b>But it’s just another trade deal?</b><br />No. Existing trade deals – of which there are dozens around the world – mostly involve lowering taxes on imports and exports, collectively known as tariffs.</p>\n<p>TTIP is different. Because tariffs are already very low between the EU and US, it will focus on “non-tariff” barriers, which essentially means regulations that get in the way of trade and investment.</p>\n<p><b>So who’s going to benefit?</b><br />Eliminating such barriers would be good news for multinational corporations, which would like to be able to operate in both the EU and the US without the time and expense involved in complying with different regulatory regimes. Many such corporations support TTIP. It will be especially helpful for the automotive, chemical, pharmaceutical and financial services industries.</p>\n<p>The deal’s backers say we’ll all benefit. Their economic models predict that this liberalisation will eventually add more than $100 billion a year to the combined GDP of the EU and US, as well as creating jobs, boosting wages, lowering prices and increasing choice.

This process allows them to analyze financial patents in a wide range of patent classes.</p>\n<p>The researchers iden\xadti\xadfy 24,288 financial patents that were applied for between 2000 and 2018 and awarded by February 2019. They argue that these financial patents are good proxies for financial innovation<a></a> during this period. While the patentability of financial discoveries was contested for most of the twentieth century, a 1998 appellate court decision in <em>State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, Inc.</em> firmly established that they were patentable. In the subsequent two decades, financial patents climbed from a negligible share to between 0.4 percent and 1.1 percent of US patent awards. Furthermore, the financial patents identified by the researchers appear to capture legitimate innovations, in the sense that they are highly cited, include all of a list of recent key financial innovations, and were subject to relatively stringent patent-review processes.</p>\n<p>The patent data provide a revealing look at the changing map of financial innovation. Traditional financial institutions, like banks, produce a modest and declining share of patents, with the steepest drops around the financial crisis of 2008. Financial innovation has instead been driven by companies outside of finance, and especially by US information technology (IT) firms. The share of financial patents focused on banking has also declined, shifting instead towards applications in consumer finance and back-office areas like security and communications.</p>\n<p>Shifts in the topics of financial innovation have been accompanied by changes in its geographic footprint. The New York-Newark area saw a major drop in its share of financial patents between 2000 and 2018, while the San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland and Charlotte-Concord areas saw rapid growth.</p>\n<p>The researchers suggest that the shifts in financial innovation away from New York and away from the financial sector reflect both the push of strict financial regulation and the pull of technological opportunity. Areas with more stringent banking regulation exhibited larger drops in innovation by financial companies than by IT firms, as well as larger drops in banking-focused patents. Banks also appear to have shifted the primary location of their innovation activities to areas with lighter regulation. At the same time, states with greater technological development saw particularly strong financial patenting by IT and payment firms, and payment firms displayed some tendency to shift their innovation activities from areas with weak to areas with strong technological capacity.</p>\n<p><em>— Lucy Elizabeth Page</em></p>\n</div>', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

This problem is how to meet (mostly historical) income-in-retirement promises made by employers to their staff.</p><p><a href="https://www.ft.com/pensions">Pensions</a> represent a greater portion of British household wealth than housing, and the UK is unusual in having so much of its pension promises fully funded. To put this in an international context, UK pension assets account for 120 per cent of UK GDP, far more than Germany (8 per cent), France (12 per cent), or Japan (31 per cent), although less than the US (174 per cent), according to the OECD. Funded <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/investmentspensionsandtrusts/datasets/fundedoccupationalpensionschemesintheuk">defined benefit schemes</a> hold about £2tn of assets, and defined contribution schemes account for a further £213bn.</p><p>Since the ONS began counting in 2004, private firms have made £520bn of employer cash contributions into the DB schemes they sponsor. While 2022 has hit asset values to the tune of £400bn, the monumental rise in bond yields has shrunk the present value of their liabilities by even more, leaving schemes in a vastly improved financial position. (When bond yields rise, the present value of pension liabilities falls.)</p><p>Such has been the combination of outsized employer contributions and rising bond yields, the problem that such schemes exist to address — how to provide pension security to retirees — has now largely been solved. For current and future retirees lucky enough to have access to a defined benefit pension this is wonderful news. So too is it for firms exhausted by their pension fund’s seemingly perpetual calls for fresh capital. But from a societal perspective, the disappearance of this problem throws up new challenges.</p><p>Firms sponsoring well-funded DB schemes can offload their obligations towards members, in what is known as the bulk annuity or “buy-out” market. This is the end goal of many sponsors. For a price, an insurance company will take over the responsibility for paying their retirees. This price is typically paid in cash and gilts, and the assets are then invested by the insurer into a range of bonds, private debt and equity release mortgages.

Goldman Sachs data on corporate plans, meanwhile, estimates that funded status increased, from 98 percent in 2021 to 100 percent in 2022.</p><p>But these numbers obfuscate the level of volatility that corporate plan investors faced in 2022. </p><p>According to WTW, which analyzed pension data for 356 Fortune 1000 companies with defined benefit plans, investment returns are estimated to have averaged –19 percent in 2022. Total corporate pension plan assets declined by 26 percent to $1.22 trillion for the year.</p>\n \n<p>“It’s actually been a crazy year,” said Jason Wilhite, senior director of retirement at growth at WTW by phone. “If you [had] told me assets would go down by more than 25 percent over the year, I’d [have told] you funded status would go down.”</p><p>But that didn’t happen because of the unique relationship between interest rates and pension liabilities. When rates increase, pension plan liabilities fall — meaning corporations do not have to save as much to be able to pay retirees what they’re promised. (Pension liabilities are calculated based on long-term corporate bond yields — when they rise, the calculations actuaries use show liabilities falling.)</p><p>Here’s how it played out last year. Pension obligations fell by 26 percent in tandem with plan asset value, per WTW data. “It was a bit of a remarkable coincidence that both assets and liabilities fell by such a large but similar amount,” said Joe McDonald, senior partner at Aon, in a phone interview. Although 2022 may have been unkind to investment portfolios, it didn’t harm the health of corporate pension plans in the same way.</p><p>“Portfolio values did suffer, yet funded ratios remained pretty steady,” McDonald said.</p>\n \n<p>Given the stability of funding, as well as the threat of an impending recession, more pension plans are now considering risk transfer transactions. These allow corporations to move their plans to third-parties, most often insurance companies. Under these arrangements, the insurance company manages the investments, takes on the risks of the portfolio, and is responsible for paying beneficiaries.</p><p>According to McDonald, the value of pension risk transfers reached roughly $50 billion, the largest year on record. He believes that activity in 2023 could be similar.</p><p>For some corporate pension plans, the task in 2023 will be to reconsider asset allocation, rather than to offload risk entirely. “There’s been a substantial repricing in all assets,” said one corporate pension CIO, who declined to comment on the record. “Equities are a lot cheaper. Bonds are substantially cheaper than they have been in the past years, so expected returns going forward are quite a bit higher. There’s reason to be optimistic.”</p><p>McDonald noted that Aon is advising some clients to diversify their fixed-income away from primarily holding Treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds. Mortgages, insurance-linked securities, real estate debt, and private credit are all attractive options.</p>\n \n<p>Delta Air Lines’ $16 billion pension plan is considering some of these assets, according to CIO Jon Glidden. Although Delta’s 2022 investment returns were negative, its funded status surpassed 100 percent in October of 2022 and then dropped off by year end to 98 percent, according to Glidden.</p><p>As a result, Glidden and his team increased the allocation to investment-grade fixed income and Treasury derivatives and sold off equity, REIT, and high-yield credit derivatives.</p><p>Delta’s investment strategy relies heavily on portable alpha, using derivatives to achieve all its beta exposure, and investing the rest of its capital into private assets and hedge funds.

It also said total pension assets have nearly doubled in the past decade, from $29.3 trillion in 2011.</p><p>The study found that pension market concentration has increased, and that the US continues to be largest pension market, with estimated total pension assets of just over $35 trillion. The UK and Japan are a distant second and third with $3.86 trillion and $3.68 trillion, respectively. Combined, the three markets account for more than 75% of all pension assets worldwide. And the seven largest markets for pension assets—Australia, Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK, and the US—account for a combined 92% of the 22 largest markets.</p><p>“Pensions are becoming better funded in many countries but have also been subject to the growth in value of financial markets,” Marisa Hall, co-head of the Thinking Ahead Institute, said in a statement. “High valuations imply financial security but also pose difficult questions about future allocations—and will encourage many pension schemes to continue looking beyond the traditional asset classes in order to maintain returns.”</p><p>Asset allocation patterns have steadily shifted since 2001, according to the study, with the allocation to equities decreasing while investments in other assets such as alternatives and real estate have grown over the past 20 years. The average global asset allocation within the seven largest markets as of the end of 2021 was 45% in equities, 34% in bonds, 19% in “other,” and 2% in cash. Australia and the US have the largest asset allocation to equities at 53% and 50%, respectively, while the UK and Japan invest the most conservatively with only 29% each in equities and 62% and 56%, respectively, allocated to bonds.</p><p>Defined contribution pensions continue to show strong growth, and after accounting for the majority of assets in the seven largest pension markets for the first time in 2020, DC pensions now represent 54% of all pension assets. The study also found that the 20-year growth of DC in the seven largest markets has been 7.8% per year, compared with 4.1% per year for defined benefit plans in dollar terms.</p><p>Additionally, the study said pension assets have significantly outpaced economic growth in each country in recent years. It said that during the past decade, the ratio of pension assets to GDP increased the most in the Netherlands, Australia, Switzerland, and the US, in that order. The Netherlands has the highest ratio of pension assets to GDP at 213%, followed by Australia (172%), Canada (170%), Switzerland (157%), the US (153%), and the UK (124%).</p><p>Related Stories:</p><p><a href="https://www.ai-cio.com/news/worlds-largest-300-pension-funds-aum-surge-11-5-in-2020/">World’s Largest 300 Pension Funds’ AUM Surge 11.5% in 2020</a></p><p><a href="https://www.ai-cio.com/news/pension-fund-assets-largest-markets-rise-11-2020/">Pension Fund Assets in Largest Markets Rise 11% in 2020</a></p><p><a href="https://www.ai-cio.com/news/worlds-largest-pension-funds-aum-8-2019/">World’s Largest Pension Funds’ AUM Up 8% in 2019</a></p><p>Tags: <a href="https://www.ai-cio.com/tag/defined-contribution/">Defined Contribution</a>, <a href="https://www.ai-cio.com/tag/global-pension-assets-study/">Global Pension', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

The African Development Bank reckons that the continent needs $130bn-170bn of infrastructure spending a year to bring roads, water, power and internet to its people. Businesses are crying out for capital. What little they get often comes from foreigners, who are quick to pack their bags when things get tough. There is no such risk with local pension funds, which collectively manage around $350bn of assets in sub-Saharan Africa, according to RisCura, an investment firm. And yet many local funds say they struggle to find places to invest.</p><p>Pension funds have grown impressively in recent decades, for diverse reasons. In South Africa the government pumped cash into the civil service pension scheme to allay members’ worries about losing benefits at the end of apartheid. Its successor, the Government Employees Pension Fund (<small>GEPF</small>), is the largest in Africa, with assets of about $110bn. In Nigeria a mandatory pension system was introduced in 2004, and funds’ combined assets have grown nine-fold over the past 15 years, to $31bn.</p><p>Pension schemes typically cover only the small fraction of Africans who have formal jobs. But they can still be big fish in small ponds. In Namibia, for example, the value of retirement fund assets is larger than the country’s annual <small>GDP</small>.</p><div><figure><div><p></p></div></figure><p>What to do with all that money? Consider the choices laid out by Richard Byarugaba, the managing director of Uganda’s National Social Security Fund. It already owns a third of the shares traded freely on the local stock exchange, where only 16 companies are listed. An alternative is property, like the ill-fated Pension Towers, but building things is much more complicated than just “pumping concrete in”, he notes. So 78% of the fund’s investment is in bonds and the like, mostly government debt (see chart). In Africa, unlike in rich regions, that yields high returns.</p><p>This reliance on government securities is typical of fund managers almost everywhere except South Africa, which has uniquely deep capital markets. The Public Investment Corporation, which manages the assets of the <small>GEPF</small>, puts 41% of its investment into listed equities, as well as 7% into an unlisted portfolio that has drawn scrutiny for alleged improprieties. Pension pots in Botswana and Namibia also invest an unusual amount in equities, often abroad. The Botswana Public Officers Pension Fund could buy up the entire national debt and still have money to spare. Moemedi Malindah, its chief executive, says it would like to invest more locally, but options are limited: it had so much trouble finding private-equity managers that it had to run a programme to create them.</p><p>Talk of diversifying into alternative assets runs ahead of reality. In Nigeria, for example, pension funds put just 0.5% of their assets into infrastructure. That is partly because fund managers find it hard to assess the prospects of greenfield projects with unproven cash flows, says Wale Okunrinboye of Sigma Pensions, one of the largest funds in the country.

Perhaps most remarkably, defined contribution plan assets fell 14.5% to $4.73 trillion vs. the 13.6% decline of defined benefit plan assets to $7.43 trillion, a stark reversal of a decadeslong trend that has seen DC plans outpace DB growth in part due to 401(k)s emerging as the primary corporate retirement plan.</p>\n<p>For the year ended Sept. 30, the Russell 3000 index and Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond index returned -17.6% and -14.6%, respectively."We think a lot of returns were pulled forward in 2020 and 2021, just given the extraordinary stimulus that was put into the economy" as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, said Jeffrey MacLean, CEO of Verus Advisory Inc., El Segundo, Calif.</p>\n<p>"So, you know the fallout from that is that the returns had to come from some years, and obviously 2022 got hit pretty hard. At a higher level, our markets have been experiencing lower and lower interest rates gradually for decades, and that regime changed very abruptly in 2022 when the Fed had no choice but to respond to inflationary pressures throughout the economy," Mr. MacLean said.</p>\n<p>"Certainly (there were) the supply chain disruptions of COVID, but also the sheer volume of money that was printed and is now circulating throughout the economy has caused inflation to be higher than it\'s been in really over 30 years," he said.</p>\n</div><div>\n<p>Among the defined benefit plans within the 200 largest U.S. plan sponsors, the change in average asset mix reflected the difficult market return environment, with average allocations to domestic fixed income falling to 21% as of Sept. 30 from 22.8% a year earlier, domestic equity to 20.3% from 21.9% and international equity falling to 12.2% from 14.5%.</p>\n<p>"We saw a correlation between equity and fixed-income returns that we haven\'t seen in a very long time," said Jonathan Pliner, a New York-based senior director and U.S. head of delegated portfolio management at Willis Towers Watson PLC. "There were very few places for plan sponsors to hide purely from an asset perspective."</p>\n<p>"We certainly still think there\'s a fair amount of uncertainty from where we sit today,\'\' he said. "There\'s a lot of different plausible scenarios that could play out from a market and economic standpoint, so we think there may be a lot of market participants that are anticipating a recession."</p>\n<p>But Mr. Pliner said there\'s also a reasonable probability of a soft landing. From the company\'s perspective, diversification will continue to be key in looking for assets that are driven by different return drivers. Finding areas beyond traditional equities and fixed income where clients can get a different return stream is as important today as it\'s ever been, he added.</p>\n<p>Public defined benefit funds in particular have moved more and more toward alternatives for years. While the average allocations to public markets dropped among the top 200 DB plans, the average asset allocation to private equity increased to 15.2% as of Sept. 30, up from 12.8% a year earlier, real estate equity rose to 11.8% from 8% and the general alternative investments category rose to 10.2% from 8.3%.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.pionline.com/article/20081027/PRINT/310279998', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

That, it appears, is what is happening to Corporate Pakistan when it comes to retirement liabilities, with the energy, textile, and petrochemical sectors especially vulnerable.</p>\n<p>According to an analysis conducted by Elphinstone Pakistan, a securities advisory company that specialises in company retirement plans, a majority of companies in the country have retirement expenses and obligations to their employees that have been growing faster than their revenues for much of the past decade, and if left unchecked, will drastically cut into operating profit margins at many companies.</p>\n<p>To put it in concrete terms, total retirement liabilities for Pakistani companies have grown from 6.5% of operating profits in 2014 to 9.4% of operating profits by 2020, an alarmingly fast rise that is likely to have a significant impact on the financial health of most companies.</p>\n<p>In this story, we will examine just how bad the problem is, and which companies and sectors have a worse problem than others. We will take a look at how we got to this mess, and the role played by the labour and tax law in Pakistan in creating this problem. Finally, we will examine potential solutions companies might be able to adopt.\xa0</p>\n<p>(Disclosure: the author of this story is the CEO of Elphinstone, a financial advisory firm that helps set up and administer retirement funds for companies and their employees.)</p>\n<p><b>The scale of the private sector retirement problem</b></p>\n<div><p>Article continues after this advertisement</p></div><p>Employee retirement obligations are a bigger problem than you think. For the 414 publicly listed companies included in Elphinstone’s analysis, the total amount of retirement obligations as of the end of financial year 2021 were Rs 651 billion, or about Rs 937,000 per employee. Even if one excludes some of the government-backed companies – which have excessively onerous pension obligations – the amount of corporate retirement liabilities comes out to Rs 565,000 per employee at the end of 2021.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>More importantly from the perspective of companies, this is a problem that is not just big, but growing at a rate faster than most companies’ ability to pay for it. For the seven years between 2014 and 2021, company spending on retirement obligations towards their employees has grown, on average, 400 basis points faster than revenue growth, for the publicly listed companies included in Elphinstone’s analysis. (One basis point is one-hundredth of one percent.) So, for example, if revenue has been growing at the average company at 10% per year, their retirement spending has been growing at 14% per year.</p>\n<p>And in case you are a smart CFO who thinks: “Well, there is a difference between when a liability is incurred and when I actually have to pay it,” the above statistic is not about liabilities. It is about actual cash outflow for a company or the portion of the liability that has actually come due in the relevant year. Liabilities have been growing slightly faster: about 470 basis points faster than revenue between 2014 and 2021, according to the analysis of publicly listed companies.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the relatively narrow gap between the growth rate for liabilities and the growth rate for actual cash paid suggests that many Pakistani companies – particularly those that have been in business for a few decades – have hit a tipping point where their long-serving employees have begun to retire and are now owed those large sums of money that the company has previously been recording as a liability on its balance sheet.</p>\n<p>This problem is particularly acute for some sectors. For refineries, for example, retirement expenses have been growing at an average of 21% per year faster than revenue growth. For automobile parts manufacturers, it is a nearly 16% per year average over and above revenue growth. For these companies, retirement spending as a percentage of revenues will double in less than five years. For the textile sector, fertilisers, power generation and distribution, and oil and gas companies, retirement expenses will double as a percentage of revenue over the next six to 10 years.</p>\n<p>The problem that companies had been kicking down the road, in other words, is here.

But it is a trend that will significantly impact the insurance sector. This is because much of the insurance industry still operates pre-Internet ways of working. It is also because many personal lines are being atomised. Small parcels of insurance protection cannot be packaged and sold with human input and also remain cost-effective.\xa0 It is also because customers demand it. They want a purely digital experience that does not require human contact when a machine will do nicely, thank you.</p>\n<p>One to watch: <strong>ZhongAn</strong></p>\n<p>InsurTech trends article: <a href="https://www.the-digital-insurer.com/blog/insurtech-digital-advisor-gamechanger/">Is the Rise of the Digital Advisor the new InsurTech Game Changer?</a></p>\n<p><strong><em>InsurTech Trend #2 – Insurance premiums will become highly personalised based on greater tech enabled insight on customers and their individual risk</em></strong></p>\n<p>When you add together the massive growth in new sources of data together with tech enabled data science, it is inevitable that premiums will become highly personalised. This will be enabled by tech such as wearables, telematics, IoT, smartphone apps. Not to mention the ability to build insights through relationships that exists across data sets. Gone will be the days when people of the same age and gender, with identical cars or homes living on the same street will pay the same premium. In the future, other factors will apply to reflect greater granularity in their individual risk profiles.

(663, 'Top 5 health insurance trends to watch', 'https://www.benefitnews.com/advisers/opinion/health-insurance-trends-for-employee-benefit-advisers', "<div><div><p>There’s no question the health insurance industry is evolving. New technology is empowering employees’ health decisions. There’s big data. Online enrollment. More choice. And, of course, there’s still the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>For brokers and advisers, it’s vital to keep an eye on hot button issues and emerging trends — doing so provides increased value for both you and your clients. An adviser’s ability to share insights and offer guidance drives client retention as well as referrals that can lead to new business. With that said, here are five insurance issues advisers should watch.</p><p><b>1. The future of the Affordable Care Act.</b> 2018 culminated with the end of the Affordable Care Act 2019 renewal period and ushered in a new era of uncertainty on the future of the law. While the healthcare law moves closer to a return visit to the Supreme Court on the basis of constitutionality, benefits professionals should keep an eye on any proposed changes — and the impact they could have on small group clients’ access to care, insurance coverage and no-charge preventive services.</p><p><b>2. Increasing use of predictive modeling.</b> One of the primary drivers for innovation we see everywhere is based on the ability to access data, specifically, consumer behavioral data. The introduction of big data has led to an era where technology monitors what we’re buying, when we’re buying, what we looked at before we made our purchase, how much we paid, if we’re a repeat customer and so on. This kind of information allows companies to predict how their customers will engage with their products — essentially, a business crystal ball.</p><div><figure> <div> <figcaption>A blood pressure monitor stands in the diagnostic imaging area at the Hong Kong Integrated Oncology Centre in Hong Kong, China, on Tuesday, Nov. 3, 2015.

Photographer: Xaume Olleros/Bloomberg</figcaption><p>Xaume Olleros/Bloomberg</p> </div> </figure></div><p>Predictive modeling has already begun to affect the employee benefits vertical as well. Giving benefits professionals the ability to offer solutions specific to an employee’s age, income, current and future medical needs, medical service usage and other relevant information based on the behavior of like-minded consumers is powerful. Beyond that, new consumer tools that help people make choices based on lifestyle, prescription drug use, how frequently they visit the doctor and other factors are making for a more customized approach to healthcare.</p><p><b>3. Combining health data.</b> An increasing number of consumers manage and track their health, from fitness and calorie tracking to overall health management. The majority of information is monitored using apps accessible on smartphones or wearable technology. Similarly, data is being captured specific to employee benefits and utilization, from plan benefits selection and financial contributions to overall usage. Benefits advisers should acquaint themselves with health system portals featuring patient information and appointment scheduling that could be integrated in future consumer apps. </p><p><b>4. Increased automation.</b> When federally facilitated and ACA state-based marketplaces opened, there was a lot of noise about the seemingly un-personalized, automated approach to customer service. However, automated systems with built-in agent alerts for follow-up with clients are the future of our industry. Those who adopt automated client management tools in 2019 will improve the quality of their contacts and drive positive business growth. Online enrollment is one example. It’s advantageous to business owners, employees and agents. In addition, it saves time, streamlines set-up, reduces errors and allows for easy plan comparisons.</p><p><b>5. Business growth through acquisition.</b> According to AARP, about 10,000 baby boomers reach retirement age every day. It’s safe to say the health insurance industry will continue to be affected by the increasing agent retirement rate in 2019, as they close or look to sell their businesses. That trend presents new business opportunities for agents who are on the upswing of their careers. </p></div><div> <p> President &amp; CEO, Choice Administrators </p> </div>", datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Systems and capabilities were improved, while agile talent and technology strategies paid off. But is the industry ready for emerging challenges heading into 2023 (and beyond)? The road ahead is dotted with multiple hurdles—rising inflation, interest rates, and loss costs; the looming threats of recession, climate change, and geopolitical upheaval; and competition from InsurTechs and even noninsurance entities such as e-tailers and manufacturers, to name a few. This is no time for carriers to be satisfied with the adaptations they’ve had to make.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/us175368_cfs_fsi-outlook-insurance/DI_US175368_CFS_FSI-Outlook-Insurance.pdf">Download the 2023 insurance industry outlook to learn more.</a></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n <p>Instead, they should be building upon the momentum they’ve achieved to maintain an ongoing culture of innovation while making customer-centricity the focal point of the industry’s standard operating model.

As of May 12, average replacement costs were up 16.3%—nearly twice the Consumer Price Index rise.</p>\n<h4>But opportunities abound for proactive nonlife players\xa0</h4>\n<p>The reinvention revolution in the small-business insurance market, the global transition to green energy and related insurance products, coverage for emerging exposures among intangible assets such as cryptocurrency, nonfungible tokens (NFTs), and virtual activities on the metaverse, all point toward plenty of room for growth.</p>\n<h4>Life insurers transformation likely key to sustainable growth</h4>\n<p>The pandemic-driven surge in premium growth since 2020 appears to be waning driven by obstacles like inflation-driven disposable income pressure and financial market volatility.<br />\n</p>\n<p>Carriers should respond to economic pressure and COVID-19–related uncertainties with proactive measures like doubling down on their pandemic-spurred digital enhancements, introducing new products, services, and distribution options, or by seeking out previously underserved customer niches.</p>\n<h4>Group insurers are getting innovative amid shifting dynamics</h4>\n<p>To facilitate portfolio expansion, many insurers are beginning to develop partnerships with other providers as well as third-party vendors. Development of “as-a-service” solutions offers another potential competitive advantage group insurers can explore.</p>\n<h4>Insurers are reinventing workplace strategies and culture as talent war intensifies\xa0</h4>\n<p>Forced virtualization of work during the pandemic has fueled revolutionary changes in employee expectations and upended many traditional employment models (figure 1).<br />\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n <p>Carriers may struggle to fill and retain their workforce through 2023 unless there are some novel changes implemented to underlying culture that help these organizations to be potentially simply irresistible.</p>\n<h4>Technology infrastructure has improved, but focus needs to shift to value realization</h4>\n<p>', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')

Several years ago, when our ancestors lived in rudimentary dwellings and had a barter economy, their decision-making primarily focused on questions like the first.</p>\n<p>As our society has evolved and our economy has become more complex, we have to deal increasingly with questions about debt repayments, retirement savings, budgeting, mortgages and lines of credit.</p>\n<p>And yet, the human brain has evolved over hundreds of years with the goal of survival. The more civilized and developed we have become, the more we are asking our brains and its associated apparatus to do what it was simply not designed to do.</p>\n<h3>Finance is non-intuitive for humans</h3>\n<p>Financial capability is one domain in which the inadequacies of humans are particularly stark. Changes in the financial landscape over the past 20 years have taxed our cognitive capabilities to new levels.</p>\n<p>In the United States and elsewhere, the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828041301632">move to defined contribution pension plans rather than defined benefits</a> has put citizens in the driver’s seat for making contribution and investment choices.</p>\n<p>Rising costs of education also require families to plan better. An increase in the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2677899?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">number of options</a> and <a href="https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/richard.thaler/research/pdf/Annuitization%20Puzzles%20(2).pdf">complexity of financial products</a> ranging from mortgages, loans, investment options and credit cards require citizens to be even more knowledgeable about their features.</p>\n<p>And easy access to credit means that citizens have to make decisions about allocating consumption over time – a relatively new skill that wasn’t needed in the pre-credit era.</p>\n<p>Finally, finance is non-intuitive to the human brain.

(675, 'How to Teach Your Child Financial Literacy - Center for Children and Youth', 'https://ccy.jfcs.org/how-to-teach-your-child-financial-literacy/', '<div><div>\n<p><em>By Susan Sachs Lipman</em></p>\n<p>April is Financial Literacy Month and there’s no time like the present to give your kids some lessons that they can use for their entire lives. This is especially urgent, given some recent <a href="https://youth.gov/youth-topics/financial-capability-literacy/facts">alarming statistics about financial literacy</a> that include high rates of student and credit card debt and low rates of financial education and comprehension. No matter what your child’s age, there are ways parents can teach financial literacy at home:</p>\n<h3>Preschool</h3>\n<p>Introduce preschoolers to money when they are learning to count. Use real coins so they get a tactile experience of the different types and values (as always, be aware of choking hazards). Lots of preschoolers like to role-play real situations, so why not encourage them to play store? Take turns buying and selling play or pretend items. Older children can even create “price lists” or “receipts”. This reinforces the notion that money is exchanged for goods, in a fun and approachable way. Talk about prices when you’re at the grocery store, too. Let your children know when you need to choose between two items, based on price and affordability.</p>\n<h3>Elementary School</h3>\n<p>Encourage your child to begin saving from any money received using a dedicated jar or piggy bank. Count the money with him or her after a period of time to illustrate how much was saved. If you’re saving for something big yourself, mention that to your child as a way of modeling saving behavior. This is also a good time to introduce the idea of delayed gratification as it pertains to spending. Discuss the difference between wants and needs and ask your child if an item they want is something they need now, or something that can be purchased later (and then perhaps encourage them to save their money to pay for it.)</p>\n<p>Some children also begin receiving an allowance at this time. <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/should-you-give-your-kids-an-allowance-yes-and-no-2017-09-08">This article</a> by Marketwatch does a very good job of outlining the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/should-you-give-your-kids-an-allowance-yes-and-no-2017-09-08">pros and cons of allowances for kids</a>. In general, the experts who are cited recommend that children have some regular chores they are not expected to be paid for, but perform as part of their role as household members. Some also recommend an allowance as a way to help kids better understand income and savings, and perhaps also income as a reward for work. They also note that whether parents offer an allowance or not, the important lessons are learned when parents talk to their kids about money.</p>\n<h3>Middle School</h3>\n<p>Now’s the time to introduce more complex financial topics. Consider having your child open a bank account and have them talk to the banker to hear first-hand about interest rates and minimum requirements. Include your child in family budgeting discussions to further their ability to make wise financial decisions. Make a grocery or other relevant budget as a family and keep a chart so family members can watch and participate in the progress.</p>\n<p>Introduce concepts related to investments, such as rudimentary examples of how the stock market works. Some kids like to “pretend invest” in companies they choose. Help them check stock prices to see how their investment would have done over a period of time, perhaps over a summer. See this link to learn <a href="http://themint.org/kids/what-is-the-stock-market.html">how the stock market works</a>.</p>\n<h3>High School</h3>\n<p>While high schoolers don’t generally need credit cards yet, they should begin to understand how credit and debt work and be introduced to the concept of high interest rates associated with carrying debt. Educate your child about their (future) credit score. Talk about the very good reasons one might incur debt, such as taking out student, home or car loans.</p>\n<p>If your child is nearing college age, involve him', datetime.date(2023, 10, 2), 'Metaphor API')
